What happens is you realize time is not scarce, insight is. Access to ideas that stimulate you, teach you, make you breathe life. So if you really must maximize something, maximize insight, not time.

We live by the rigidity of a clock rather than the simplicity of emotion. We are desperate for unscheduled time — free of a purpose — for a richer inner life, for a space that does not exist contingent on time. Thankfully we can do something about it, starting with letting time just be.

This is just a parable on two philosophies of time: chronos and kairos. The former is the time of clocks from seconds to years. It measures time. The latter is the time of living and experiencing. It measures moments. One is quantitative, the other is qualitative. - Ideas come from Alan Lightman, his book, *In Praise of Wasting Time*.
