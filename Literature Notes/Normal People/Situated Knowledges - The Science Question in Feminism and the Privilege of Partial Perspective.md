Donna Haraway - a historian of science, known for blending feminist theory with science and technology studies. Her work often explores how science is socially and culturally constructed.

This reading describes feminist critiques of objectivity in science. Haraway argues against the traditional notion of detached scientific objectivity and introduces a concept of 'situated knowledge.’ Situated knowledge is unique in that it acknowledges the observer's specific location (or situation) in terms of geography, society, and personal history. She critiques the ideal of a perfect and unbiased/neutral view in science. She suggests instead that all knowledge is situated and limited–influenced by human factors including gender, culture, and politics.

Haraway's main argument is that all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, is inherently partial and situated. She challenges the "God trick,” the view from nowhere, which claims an objective view from a disembodied, universal perspective. Instead, she advocates for acknowledging the specific contexts from which knowledge is generated. She argues this approach can lead to more accountable and responsible scientific practices. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the roles of power and identity in shaping knowledge, pushing for a science aware of its limitations and biases.
