The Overfitted Brain Hypothesis suggests that dreams prevent the brain from overfitting to the daily stimuli it encounters. This idea stems from techniques used in training artificial neural networks. This hypothesis proposes that by generating "noisy" or "corrupted" inputs during sleep, dreams help maintain the brain's generalizability and flexibility, thereby enhancing cognitive function.

Dreams introduce variability and randomness in the form of "corrupted inputs," which counteract the brain's tendency to overfit its daily sensory inputs. 

The paper draws analogies between mechanisms to combat overfitting in neural networks and the hypothesized function of dreams. Dreams might optimize brain function through â€œdropout" and "domain randomization."
