This article examines the clash between genomic and Indigenous definitions of indigeneity. Genomic science emphasizes genetic ancestry and biological descent as key markers of identity, while indigenous groups focus on political status, kinship, and long-standing relationships with land and community. TallBear critiques how genomic science often overrides indigenous ways of knowingâ€“particularly in matters of identity and self-determination. The article explores these tensions through different case studies. There is specific mention of DNA testing for tribal enrollment and the Kennewick Man controversy. TallBear warns that adopting genomic perspectives can undermine Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination.

Main Arguments:

1. Genomic science often uses genetic ancestry to define indigeneity, which contrasts with Indigenous communities' multifaceted understanding of identity. Indigenous peoples prioritize relational identities (based on cultural and political ties) and kinship with land and community.
    
2. Genomic articulations often echo the outdated notion of the "vanishing Indian," which suggests that Indigenous people are disappearing due to genetic admixture. This is in direct contrast with the indigenous perspective that focuses on survival and resilience.
    
3. Genomic definitions have started to infiltrate tribal policies where DNA testing is increasingly used to determine biological descent. TallBear argues that this reliance on genetics can threaten Indigenous sovereignty by shifting the basis of identity from political and cultural ties to genetic markers.
    
4. The article discusses the unequal power relationships between Indigenous peoples and scientists, with the latter often having greater authority to define identity. This imbalance can result in the imposition of genomic frameworks over indigenous ones.
