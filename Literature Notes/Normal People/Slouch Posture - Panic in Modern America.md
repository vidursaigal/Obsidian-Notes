The reading examines how posture science was driven by societal anxieties about "poor posture" and its association with negative health and social outcomes. The development of the "posture panic" can be traced to institutions like the military and schools. These institutions utilized posture assessments to gauge physical fitness and moral character. This weird obsession with posture was tied to eugenic ideals and a fundamental societal fear of disability. Posture science was not just about health; it was a tool for enforcing norms around whiteness, able-bodiedness, and social superiority.

Main Arguments:
1. Posture science became a tool for distinguishing the able-bodied from the disabled and the morally "upright" from the deviant.
2. Linker argues that posture science was intertwined with eugenics, as it sought to regulate and perfect bodies according to racial and ableist ideals—the push for good posture aligned with societal desires to control race, health, and productivity.
3. Schools, the military, and public health campaigns perpetuated posture assessments as a way to surveil and discipline bodies. These institutions helped spread the belief that poor posture was an epidemic that needed to be corrected to maintain national strength.
4. Despite the decline of explicit posture surveillance, modern wellness industries still reflect the same anxieties about physical fitness and societal health.

Insights For Class:
1. One of Linker’s key arguments is that posture science wasn't just about individual health but was used as a tool of state surveillance and control. The U.S. military and educational institutions played significant roles in promoting posture science as part of a broader effort to regulate bodies and maintain social order. How does this historical example of posture surveillance compare to modern forms of body regulation, such as health screenings, fitness mandates, or even the use of biometric data for employment?
2. Linker connects posture science to racial politics, revealing how white Americans viewed posture as a marker of civilization, while non-white groups were often framed as pre-civilized or physically inferior. The posture sciences became a vehicle for racial superiority narratives. Can we draw parallels to modern discussions about race, fitness, and health disparities? How do these historical narratives continue to influence the way we think about "ideal" bodies today?
