1. Schiebinger argues that scientific knowledge (anatomy and anthropology) has been shaped by gendered perspectives. She highlights how male scientists in the 18th century prioritized traits like facial hair as indicators of human hierarchyâ€“often projecting their cultural biases onto scientific classification. Additionally, Schiebinger points out how the absence of women in academia contributed to the biased nature of "objective" science.
    
2. European anatomists classified humans based on perceived racial and sexual differences. Figures like Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring studied African bodies and promoted theories that attributed physical and cultural characteristics to inherent racial types.
    
3. Racial classifications were based on arbitrary physical traits, such as skull shape and skin color. These classifications often supported European superiority and downplayed diversity within racial groups.
    
4. European standards of beauty influenced scientific interpretations. Blumenbach coined the term "Caucasian," considering Georgians as the most beautiful and therefore the archetype of humanity.
    
5. Two competing views on racial differences emerged: environmentalists argued that climate and customs shaped racial traits, while biological determinists saw these traits as inherent and unchangeable.
