Canguilhem challenges the traditional notion that disease is merely a quantitative deviation from health. He argues that health is defined by distinct sets of norms. Canguilhem introduces the concept of "biological normativity." This says that living organisms create their own norms in response to environmental challenges. Thus, health is a dynamic process that allows for the creation of new norms; on the other hand, disease reflects a reduction in the capacity to adapt to new situations. Canguilhem rejects the view that normalcy can be determined strictly through objective scientific means.

Main Arguments:
1. Canguilhem refutes the idea that disease is simply a quantitative variation of normal physiological functions. He argues that disease and health are governed by different sets of norms.
2. Life is defined by its ability to establish its norm. Health is not static; it is the ability to create new norms in response to challenges. Disease, on the other hand, limits this capacity and represents a reduced ability to adapt.
3. The distinction between health and disease cannot be universally applied–norms are relative to the individual’s unique situation. A pathological state for one person could be normal for another. Hence, norms must be understood in relation to the individual and their environment.
4. Canguilhem argues that medicine is not merely a scientific practice but an activity rooted in human efforts to dominate the environment.
5. Disease is not the absence of normativity; rather, it is a different form of it. Canguilhem asserts that curing disease is not about restoring a previous state of health but about creating new norms that allow the individual to function again.
6. Pathology is defined not only through objective measurements but also through the patient’s experience and clinical practice. There is no purely "objective pathology," as the concept of disease is always tied to values and individual experiences.


In Class Discussion Notes Below:


Apply this weeks reading to categories/classifications from last week? 


43-44 - Average is the ideal characteristics

47-48 - 
1. **Homogeneity and Type**: Galton adopted Quetelet’s notion of homogeneity to create categories or “types” that could be used to classify individuals. This reflects an early understanding of statistical normality, where characteristics can be averaged to identify common traits within a population.

2. **Race Classification**: Galton’s application of this classification approach to race implies an attempt to create a scientific basis for categorizing human groups. By leveraging statistical norms, he sought to differentiate between groups based on physical characteristics, suggesting that certain traits could define larger populations.

3. **Fingerprint Classification**: Galton also extended these ideas to the analysis of fingerprints, which he viewed as unique identifiers that could be systematically categorized. This work laid the foundation for modern forensic science and the classification of individuals based on biometrics.

4. **Composite Photography**: The reference to composite photography underscores Galton’s interest in capturing an “average type” of person by combining images of multiple individuals. This technique was intended to eliminate individual anomalies and represent a statistical ideal. It reflects his belief in the utility of averages in understanding human variation and establishing norms.

5. **Scientific Objectivity**: By using statistical methods to classify human types, Galton positioned his work as scientific and objective, distancing it from subjective judgments. However, this approach raises questions about the ethical implications of such classifications, especially in relation to race.

Last article:
1. **Variability and the Gaussian Curve**: Physiological activities can vary and are often represented by a Gaussian (normal) distribution, where “normal” is defined by a range around the median determined by standard deviations.

2. **Distinction Between Variations**: There is no clear line between healthy variations (innate) and those that indicate disease (acquired). Significant deviations from the average may suggest a predisposition to illness.

3. **John A. Ryle’s Needs for Understanding Normality**: Ryle identifies four medical needs related to the concept of “normal”:

• Defining what constitutes a pathological state (disease).

• Establishing functional levels to aim for in treatment or rehabilitation.

• Choosing suitable personnel for industry.

• Identifying predispositions to disease.

4. **Criteria of Expertise**: The latter three needs relate to assessing capabilities, risks, and health outcomes, which are essential for making informed decisions in medical and occupational contexts.

5. **Types of Variations**: Ryle distinguishes between two types of variations:

• Temporal variations within the same individual.

• Variations across different individuals at a specific time.

6. **Importance of Variability**: Both types of variability are crucial for adaptability, which is essential for survival. However, studying adaptability requires considering not only physiological measures but also environmental, social, economic, and educational factors.

7. **Fitness and Adaptability**: The concept of “normal” serves as an indicator of fitness and adaptability, prompting questions about the context and purpose of this adaptability.


Categorize between the norms of being "healthy" or "diseased" -> then use this to characterize populations.
