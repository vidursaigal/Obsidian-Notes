Canguilhem challenges the traditional notion that disease is merely a quantitative deviation from health. He argues that health is defined by distinct sets of norms. Canguilhem introduces the concept of "biological normativity." This says that living organisms create their own norms in response to environmental challenges. Thus, health is a dynamic process that allows for the creation of new norms; on the other hand, disease reflects a reduction in the capacity to adapt to new situations. Canguilhem rejects the view that normalcy can be determined strictly through objective scientific means.

Main Arguments:
1. Canguilhem refutes the idea that disease is simply a quantitative variation of normal
physiological functions. He argues that disease and health are governed by different sets of
norms.
2. Life is defined by its ability to establish its norm. Health is not static; it is the ability to create
new norms in response to challenges. Disease, on the other hand, limits this capacity and
represents a reduced ability to adapt.
3. The distinction between health and disease cannot be universally applied–norms are relative to
the individual’s unique situation. A pathological state for one person could be normal for
another. Hence, norms must be understood in relation to the individual and their
environment.
4. Canguilhem argues that medicine is not merely a scientific practice but an activity rooted in
human efforts to dominate the environment.
5. Disease is not the absence of normativity; rather, it is a different form of it. Canguilhem asserts
that curing disease is not about restoring a previous state of health but about creating new
norms that allow the individual to function again.
6. Pathology is defined not only through objective measurements but also through the patient’s
experience and clinical practice. There is no purely "objective pathology," as the concept of
disease is always tied to values and individual experiences.
