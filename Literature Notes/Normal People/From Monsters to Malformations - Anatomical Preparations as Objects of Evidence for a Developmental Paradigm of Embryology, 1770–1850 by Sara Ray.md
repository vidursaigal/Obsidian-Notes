1. Ray outlines how anatomical “monsters” were initially collected for their curiosity value but evolved into structured objects of scientific inquiry. This laid the foundational frameworks for teratology and developmental embryology.
    
2. Anatomical collections became models for studying physiological development. Preparations were crafted to demonstrate deviations from “normal” anatomy; the constancy of forms across specimens allowed for extrapolation about natural developmental laws.
    
3. Anatomical preparations were central in establishing a comparative methodology for studying embryological development. By comparing various malformations, scientists could identify stages of developmental failure, which Ray argues helped produce a coherent developmental paradigm.
    
4. Ray discusses how teratology applied gradation scales to abnormalities (e.g., cyclopia), reflecting developmental progression. This framework moved beyond simple “monstrous” versus “normal” distinctions–categorizing malformations according to developmental milestones.
    
5. Ray explains that anatomical collections illustrated natural variation and shared evolutionary origins between species. Teratology connected humans to other species through shared developmental processes.
