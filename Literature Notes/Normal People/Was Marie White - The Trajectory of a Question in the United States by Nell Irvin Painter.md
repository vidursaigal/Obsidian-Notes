This essay explores the changing definitions of whiteness in the United States. There is a focus on the 19th and early 20th centuries. Painter argues that racial categories are fluid and have evolved based on social and scientific influences. Using examples from census data and literature Painter highlights how whiteness has not always been a stable identity. She questions the assumption of whiteness as a neutral category and traces how non-Anglo Europeans (Irish, Slavs, and Italians) were once considered non-white.

Main Arguments:

1. Painter argues that whiteness, much like other racial categories, has been constructed and reconstructed over time.
    
2. The U.S. census and legal definitions have played significant roles in shaping who is considered white.
    
3. The concept of race is more a product of cultural imagination than a biological fact.
    
4. Painter uses the story of Marie, a character from a 19th-century novel, to demonstrate how a personâ€™s racial classification could be subject to local laws and social perceptions, even when their appearance did not align with these classifications.
