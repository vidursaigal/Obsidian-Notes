Review: Stacks and Queues 
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure; it specifies the type of data stored and the operations that can be performed, similar to a Java interface. Recall the Stack and Queue ADTs:

Stack  
• LIFO (Last-In-First-Out): the most recent element added to the stack will be removed first 
• Supported operations:
	– push: amortized O(1) 
	– pop: amortized O(1) 
	– peek: O(1) 
	– isEmpty: O(1) 
	– size: O(1)

Queue 
• FIFO (First-In-First-Out): the oldest/least recent element added to the queue will be removed first • Supported operations: 
	– enqueue: amortized O(1)
	– dequeue: amortized O(1)
	– peek: O(1)
	– isEmpty: O(1)
	– size: O(1)
