Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is a protein that regulates the immune system and protects the body from infection.
 
IFN-γ is a cytokine (see: [[Cytokines]]) that plays a key role in the immune system's response to pathogens and tumors. It has many functions, including: 
 1.) Inducing T cell activation 
 2.) Activating macrophages 
 3.) Inhibiting Th2 differentiation 
 4.) Up-regulating MHC class II expression on antigen presenting cells (APCs) 
 
IFN-γ is produced by activated T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and APCs 
 
IFN-γ has been used to treat infectious diseases, including bacterial, protozoal, viral, and fungal diseases. It has also been shown to be effective in treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. 
 
IFNG increases an anti-proliferative state in cancer cells, while up-regulating MHC I and MHC II expression, which increases immunorecognition and removal of pathogenic cells.

Type II IFN deficiency has been linked to several types of cancer, including B-cell lymphoma and lung cancer.
