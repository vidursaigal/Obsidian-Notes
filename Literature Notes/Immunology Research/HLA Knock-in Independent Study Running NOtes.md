Astrocyte cell line with A3 seperately and A2 seperately -> RNAseq after the knockdown of the astrocytes, which allows us to see if the cryptic peptides are expressed 

Start the construct ASAP

use endogenous codons or optimized codons, folding differences, (T-SCAN uses optimized codons) -> translate faster because they are optimized, which could mean that there are pausing signals present that may cause it fold incorrectly. MHC molecules are 400 nucleotides (beta2 is already in the cells, HLA2, HLA3) Knock-in/transduce all of the HLAs. (2 different versions, with HLA2 and HLA3 lets test both). 


Connors Project:
Using TRUST4 to see TCRs? -> 10x VDJ much better  (CSF uses 10VDJ, TRUST4 for PBMC)
