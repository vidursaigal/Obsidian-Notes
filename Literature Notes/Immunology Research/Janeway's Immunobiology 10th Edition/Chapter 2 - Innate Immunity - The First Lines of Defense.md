## Overview
- **Innate Immunity**: Acts within minutes or hours to detect and destroy pathogens using a limited set of preformed molecules and receptors.
- **Key Features**: 
  - No need for antigen-specific lymphocyte expansion.
  - Relies on inborn, genetically inherited receptors.
  - Critical in early infection control, even in the presence of adaptive immunity.

## Immunodeficiencies
- **Importance of Innate Immunity**: Illustrated by immunodeficiencies that lead to increased susceptibility to infection despite having a functional adaptive immune system.

## Anatomic Barriers and Initial Defenses
- **Infection begins** when a pathogen breaches one of the body’s **anatomic barriers** (e.g., skin, mucosal surfaces).
- **Immediate Defense Mechanisms**:
  1. **Soluble Molecules**: Present in extracellular fluids, blood, and secretions.
     - **Antimicrobial enzymes** (e.g., lysozyme): Digest bacterial cell walls.
     - **Antimicrobial peptides** (e.g., defensins): Lyse bacterial membranes.
     - **Complement system**: Targets pathogens for lysis or phagocytosis by innate immune cells (e.g., macrophages).
  
## Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs)
- **PRRs**: Detect molecules known as **pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)**, which are characteristic of microbes.
  - PRRs trigger the activation of **innate immune cells**.
  - These cells deploy various **effector mechanisms** to eliminate the infection.
  
## Limitation of Innate Immunity
- **No Long-term Memory**: Unlike adaptive immunity, innate immunity does not generate long-lasting immunological memory.
  
## Engagement of Adaptive Immunity
- If innate defenses fail, the body engages **adaptive immune responses**:
  - **Expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes**.
  - **Formation of memory cells** to provide long-term specific immunity.

# Anatomic Barriers and Initial Chemical Defenses

## Overview
- **Pathogenic Microorganisms**: Disease-causing microorganisms that have evolved mechanisms to overcome the body's innate defenses. These organisms replicate in hosts and can include viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and helminths (worms).
- **Innate Immunity**: Provides an initial line of defense, acting immediately to reduce pathogen numbers and slowing infections before adaptive immunity is activated.

### 2-1: Infectious Diseases and Pathogens
- **Pathogens**: Microorganisms that cause disease and can invade the host's immune system.
  - *Examples*: Viruses (e.g., Influenza), Bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), Fungi (e.g., Candida albicans), Protozoa (e.g., Plasmodium), Helminths (worms).
- **Infectious agents replicate in body compartments**: Either extracellularly (e.g., bacteria) or intracellularly (e.g., viruses). 
  - *Extracellular pathogens*: Susceptible to phagocytes.
  - *Intracellular pathogens*: Require elimination via cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells.

### 2-2: Epithelial Surfaces as Barriers
- **Epithelia**: Serve as the body’s first line of defense, protecting mucosal surfaces (respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal tracts) and skin.
  - Epithelia contain **tight junctions** and produce **antimicrobial substances** such as defensins and lysozyme.
  - **Mucus**: Mucosal surfaces secrete mucus, creating a physical barrier to microbes. Cilia in the respiratory tract help remove pathogens.
  - **Microbiota**: Non-pathogenic commensal bacteria occupy epithelial surfaces and can inhibit pathogen colonization through competition and production of antimicrobial peptides.

### 2-3: Overcoming Innate Defenses
- **Infection**: Occurs when a pathogen breaches epithelial barriers and establishes a local site of infection.
  - **Innate defenses** prevent infection in most cases, but some pathogens evade these defenses.
  - *Example*: Pathogens that adhere to epithelial surfaces to avoid being cleared by mucus flow.

### 2-4: Antimicrobial Molecules
- **Chemical defenses**: Epithelial cells and phagocytes produce a variety of antimicrobial molecules that inhibit or kill pathogens.
  - *Examples*: 
    - **Lysozyme**: An enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls (effective against Gram-positive bacteria).
    - **Defensins**: Small cationic peptides that disrupt microbial cell membranes by forming pores.
    - **RegIII proteins**: Lectins that bind to bacterial peptidoglycans and kill bacteria by forming membrane pores.
  - **Cathelicidins**: Antimicrobial peptides that disrupt bacterial membranes.
  - **Histatins**: Peptides found in the oral cavity with antifungal activity.
  - **Calprotectin**: Sequesters essential metal ions (e.g., magnesium, iron) to inhibit microbial growth.
  
## Summary
- **Epithelia**: Provide a combination of physical, chemical, and microbiological barriers that prevent pathogen entry and colonization.
- **Innate immunity mechanisms**: Include antimicrobial peptides, enzymes, and proteins that act as both **pattern-recognition receptors** and **effector molecules**. These mechanisms operate immediately upon pathogen encounter, representing the body's first line of defense before the adaptive immune system is engaged.

# The Complement System and Innate Immunity

The complement system is a vital part of innate immunity, composed of more than 30 plasma proteins, primarily produced by the liver. It functions as both a direct pathogen-killing mechanism and a support system for other immune responses.

## Pathogen Encounter and Activation
- Upon breaching epithelial barriers, pathogens encounter complement proteins circulating in inactive forms.
- Complement activation is triggered by pathogens or pathogen-bound antibodies, initiating one of three pathways:
  1. **Classical Pathway**: Triggered by antibodies bound to pathogens.
  2. **Alternative Pathway**: Activated by pathogens without antibodies.
  3. **Lectin Pathway**: Activated by lectin proteins binding to carbohydrates on pathogen surfaces.

## Pathway Activation and Outcomes
- All pathways converge at the production of **C3 convertase**, an enzyme that cleaves **C3** into **C3a** and **C3b**:
  - **C3a** induces inflammation.
  - **C3b** binds to pathogen surfaces, marking them for destruction by **phagocytosis** and contributing to the formation of **C5 convertase**.
- The **C5 convertase** cleaves **C5** into **C5a** and **C5b**:
  - **C5a** enhances inflammation and attracts immune cells.
  - **C5b** initiates the formation of the **membrane attack complex (MAC)**, leading to pathogen cell lysis.

## Effector Functions
- **Opsonization**: C3b coats pathogens, facilitating their uptake by phagocytes.
- **Inflammation**: Small fragments like C3a and C5a induce inflammation and recruit immune cells.
- **Pathogen Lysis**: MAC formation creates pores in pathogen membranes, leading to their destruction.

## Regulation
- Complement activity is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissues.
- **Factor H**, **Factor I**, and membrane-bound proteins like **MCP** and **DAF** inhibit complement activation on host cells.
- Dysregulation of complement can lead to diseases such as **hereditary angioedema (HAE)** and **age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**.

## Pathogen Evasion
- Some pathogens produce proteins that inhibit complement activation, allowing them to evade the immune response, e.g., **Neisseria meningitidis** recruits **Factor H** to inactivate C3b.


# 2-5 The Complement System Recognizes Microbial Surfaces for Destruction

The complement system plays a crucial role in marking microbial surfaces for destruction. One of its key functions is the coating of pathogens with **C3b**, a protein fragment that tags them for elimination. This process occurs across three distinct pathways:
- **Classical Pathway**
- **Lectin Pathway**
- **Alternative Pathway**

All three pathways converge at the central step of generating **C3 convertase**, which cleaves **C3** into **C3a** and **C3b**. **C3b** covalently binds to pathogen surfaces, enhancing their uptake by **phagocytes**. **C5 convertase**, formed from **C3b**, initiates the terminal pathway that results in the formation of the **membrane attack complex (MAC)**, leading to pathogen lysis.

### Pathways of Complement Activation:
- **Lectin Pathway**: Triggered by carbohydrate-binding proteins like **mannose-binding lectin (MBL)**.
- **Classical Pathway**: Initiated by **C1** binding directly to a pathogen surface or to antibodies on the pathogen.
- **Alternative Pathway**: Spontaneously activated by **C3 hydrolysis** and **properdin** binding.

### Key Proteins and Their Roles:
- **C3b**: Major opsonin that tags pathogens for destruction.
- **C5b**: Initiates the formation of the **MAC**.

# 2-6 The Lectin Pathway of Complement Activation

The **lectin pathway** is initiated when **mannose-binding lectin (MBL)** or **ficolins** recognize and bind to specific carbohydrate patterns on microbial surfaces. These proteins associate with **MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs)**, triggering cleavage of **C4** and **C2**, leading to the formation of the **C3 convertase C4b2a**.

### Steps of Activation:
1. MBL binds to carbohydrates on the pathogen surface.
2. MASP-1 activates MASP-2.
3. MASP-2 cleaves **C4** and **C2** to form **C4b2a**.
4. **C3 convertase** cleaves **C3** into **C3b**, which binds to the pathogen surface.

### Functions:
- **Opsonization**: C3b coats pathogens for easier recognition by phagocytes.
- **Amplification**: Cleavage of C3 produces more C3b, accelerating pathogen destruction.

# 2-7 The Classical Pathway of Complement Activation

The **classical pathway** is triggered when **C1** binds to antibodies or directly to pathogen surfaces. **C1** consists of three subunits: **C1q** (pathogen recognition), **C1r**, and **C1s** (proteases). C1q binding triggers activation of C1r, which activates C1s, leading to the cleavage of **C4** and **C2** to form the **C3 convertase (C4b2a)**.

### Steps of Activation:
1. C1 binds to pathogen-bound antibodies (or directly to pathogen surfaces).
2. Activation of **C1r** and **C1s**.
3. Cleavage of **C4** and **C2** to form **C4b2a**.
4. **C3 convertase** cleaves **C3** to produce **C3b**.

### Functions:
- **Link to Adaptive Immunity**: C1q can bind to antibodies from the adaptive immune system, linking complement to antibody-mediated responses.
  
# 2-8 Complement Activation Is Confined to Pathogen Surfaces

Complement activation is primarily restricted to pathogen surfaces to avoid damage to host cells. Key regulatory mechanisms, such as the rapid inactivation of **C4b** and **C3b** through hydrolysis, ensure complement activation is localized to pathogen surfaces.

### Key Mechanisms:
- **Covalent Binding**: C4b and C3b bind covalently to the pathogen surface.
- **Regulation**: Host cells have regulatory proteins that inhibit complement activation, while pathogens lack these protections.

### Importance:
- Prevents accidental complement activation on healthy host cells.
  
# 2-9 The Alternative Pathway Amplifies C3b Formation

The **alternative pathway** serves as an amplification loop for C3b formation, initiated either spontaneously by **C3 hydrolysis** or by **C3b** generated from the other pathways. The alternative pathway C3 convertase **C3bBb** cleaves C3, leading to rapid accumulation of C3b on the pathogen surface.

### Activation Mechanisms:
1. **Spontaneous C3 hydrolysis** produces **C3(H2O)**, which binds **Factor B**.
2. Factor B is cleaved by **Factor D**, forming **C3bBb**, the alternative pathway C3 convertase.
3. **Properdin** stabilizes C3bBb on pathogen surfaces, enhancing C3b production.

### Role:
- **Amplification**: Increases the deposition of C3b, accelerating pathogen opsonization and destruction.

# 2-10 Complement Regulation: Formation and Stability of C3 Convertases

Complement activation must be tightly regulated to protect host cells. Several regulatory proteins control the formation and stability of the C3 convertase:
- **Factor H** and **Factor I** promote the degradation of C3b.
- **Decay-accelerating factor (DAF)** and **membrane cofactor protein (MCP)** prevent complement activation on host cells by displacing components of the C3 convertase and promoting cleavage of C3b.

### Key Regulators:
- **Properdin**: Stabilizes C3bBb on pathogens.
- **DAF**, **MCP**, **Factor H**, and **Factor I**: Prevent complement activation on host cells by inhibiting C3 convertase formation.

# 2-11 Evolution of Complement: An Ancient Immune Mechanism

The complement system evolved early in multicellular organisms and is present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The alternative pathway is the most ancient, with homologs of **C3** and **Factor B** found in invertebrates, suggesting its early role in immune defense.

### Key Points:
- **Ancestral Pathways**: The ficolin and lectin pathways evolved later, allowing more specific targeting of pathogens.
- **Evolution of C1q**: The classical pathway likely evolved by incorporating the C1q-like proteins into the complement system.

# 2-12 C3 Convertase Leads to C5 Convertase Formation

The formation of **C3 convertase** leads to the cleavage of **C3** into **C3b** and **C3a**. C3b binds to C3 convertase, forming **C5 convertase**, which cleaves **C5** into **C5a** and **C5b**:
- **C5a**: Potent inflammatory mediator.
- **C5b**: Initiates the assembly of the **membrane attack complex (MAC)**.

### Key Events:
- C3b binding leads to **C5 convertase** formation.
- C5 cleavage initiates the terminal complement pathway, resulting in the formation of MAC.

# 2-13 Complement-Mediated Phagocytosis

**C3b** and its cleavage products bind to complement receptors on phagocytes, facilitating the uptake and destruction of complement-opsonized pathogens. Phagocytes express various complement receptors (CR1, CR3, CR4) that recognize **C3b**, **iC3b**, and **C3dg**.

### Key Receptors:
- **CR1**: Binds C3b for phagocytosis but requires C5a for full activation.
- **CR3 and CR4**: Bind iC3b and are sufficient for phagocytosis without additional signals.

# 2-14 Inflammatory Response Mediated by C3a and C5a

The small complement fragments **C3a** and **C5a** act as **anaphylatoxins**, inducing local inflammation by acting on endothelial cells and mast cells. They increase vascular permeability and recruit immune cells to the site of infection.

### Inflammatory Roles:
- **C5a**: Most potent, induces smooth muscle contraction and increases phagocyte adherence to vessel walls.
- **C3a**: Less potent but still contributes to inflammation and immune cell recruitment.

# 2-15 Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) Formation

The **membrane attack complex (MAC)** is formed by the assembly of C5b with C6, C7, C8, and multiple molecules of **C9**. This complex forms a pore in the pathogen membrane, disrupting cellular homeostasis and leading to lysis.

### MAC Formation Steps:
1. **C5b** binds **C6** and **C7**, which inserts into the membrane.
2. **C8** and **C9** polymerize, forming a pore that disrupts the membrane.

# 2-16 Complement Regulation Prevents Host Damage

Regulation of complement activation is crucial to protect host cells. Several soluble and membrane-bound proteins, like **C1 inhibitor (C1INH)**, **Factor I**, **Factor H**, **DAF**, and **MCP**, prevent excessive complement activation and protect healthy tissue.

### Key Regulatory Proteins:
- **C1INH**: Inhibits the C1 complex.
- **DAF** and **MCP**: Disrupt C3/C5 convertase formation on host cells.
- **CD59 (Protectin)**: Prevents MAC formation on host cells.

# 2-17 Disorders in Complement Regulation

Genetic or acquired defects in complement-regulatory proteins can lead to inflammatory diseases. Examples include:
- **Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS)**: Caused by mutations in **Factor H**, **Factor I**, or **MCP**, leading to uncontrolled complement activation.
- **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Linked to polymorphisms in **Factor H**, causing chronic complement activation in the retina.

# 2-18 Pathogen Strategies for Complement Evasion

Pathogens have evolved various mechanisms to evade complement activation:
- **Neisseria meningitidis** recruits **Factor H** to inactivate C3b.
- **Staphylococcus aureus** secretes proteins like **SCIN** and **Staphylokinase** to inhibit C3 convertase and cleave immunoglobulins, respectively.

### Evasion Mechanisms:
- **Binding Host Regulators**: Many pathogens mimic host surfaces by recruiting complement-regulatory proteins like **Factor H**.
- **Direct Inhibition**: Some pathogens secrete proteins that directly inhibit complement components.
# Summary of the Complement System

# Summary to Chapter 2

This chapter has covered the **preexisting, constitutive components of innate immunity**, emphasizing the body's defenses that act as barriers against pathogen entry. **Epithelial surfaces** serve as a constant but imperfect barrier. These surfaces are equipped with specialized adaptations such as **cilia**, **antimicrobial molecules**, and **mucus**, which provide the simplest forms of innate immune defense.

The **complement system** is a more specialized aspect of innate immunity, integrating **direct microbial recognition** with a **complex effector system**:
- The **lectin pathway** uses **pattern-recognition receptors** to detect microbial membranes.
- The **alternative pathway** is activated spontaneously but is downregulated by host molecules on self-membranes.
### Key Event:
- The accumulation of **C3b** on microbial membranes is central to complement activation. This opsonization event is crucial for **phagocytic clearance**, as **complement receptors** on phagocytic cells recognize C3b and promote microbial destruction.
- Inflammatory peptides like **C3a** and **C5a** recruit immune cells to infection sites, while **C5b** initiates the formation of the **membrane-attack complex (MAC)**, capable of directly lysing some pathogens.
### Regulation:
- The **complement cascade** is tightly regulated to prevent damage to host tissues. Variations in regulatory pathways can lead to **autoimmune syndromes** and contribute to **age-related tissue damage**.
