4-1 IgG antibodies consist of four polypeptide chains.
![[Pasted image 20241009044037.png]]
4-2 Immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are composed of constant and variable regions.

4-3 The domains of an immunoglobulin molecule have similar structures.

4-4 The antibody molecule can readily be cleaved into functionally distinct fragments.

4-5 The hinge region of the immunoglobulin molecule allows flexibility in binding to multiple antigens.
- Glycoproteins on virus are very sparsely separated, fab of antibody is not enough to link two glycoprotein on surface of virus 
- Hinges of fc and fab region are flexible, allowing 60 degree angles and 90 degree angles.

4-6 Different classes of immunoglobulins are distinguished by the structure of their heavy-chain constant regions.

- Placenta is tightly regulated between fetus and mother, so antibody of small size can be transferred, not the IgM pentamer
- J chain, easier to transfer from mucosal and gut regions (IgA)
- Fc receptor is small, it only has two immunoglobulin domains Fab has to bend down so that the fc receptor can
- **Two Immunoglobulin Domains:** The statement that the Fc receptor has only two immunoglobulin domains means that its structure is relatively simple compared to the full antibody, which has a more complex arrangement.
- **Bending of Fab:** The Fab (fragment antigen-binding) portion of an antibody is the region that binds to the antigen. If the Fab arms are too far apart (which can happen in certain configurations of antibodies), they may need to bend down or reposition to engage effectively with the Fc receptor. This flexibility is important for the proper orientation and interaction with the receptor, enhancing the antibody's ability to mediate immune functions.
4-7 The constant region confers functional specialization on the antibody.

4-8 IgM and IgA can form polymers by interacting with the J chain.

4-9 Localized regions of hypervariable sequence form the antigen-binding site.

4-10 Antibodies bind antigens via contacts in CDRs that are complementary to the size and shape of the antigen.
![[Pasted image 20241009045404.png]]
-CDR stands for **Complementarity-Determining Region**. It refers to the specific parts of an antibody's variable regions that directly interact with an antigen.

4-11 Antibodies bind to conformational shapes on the surfaces of antigens using a variety of noncovalent forces.

4-12 Antibody interaction with intact antigens is influenced by steric constraints.

4-13 Some species generate antibodies with alternative structures.

4-14 The TCRαβ heterodimer is very similar to a Fab fragment of immunoglobulin.

4-15 A T-cell receptor recognizes antigen in the form of a complex of a foreign peptide bound to an MHC molecule.

4-16 There are two classes of MHC molecules with distinct subunit compositions but similar three-dimensional structures.
![[Pasted image 20241009050054.png]]
4-17 Peptides are stably bound to MHC molecules and also serve to stabilize the MHC molecule on the cell surface.

4-18 MHC class I molecules bind short peptides of 8–10 amino acids by both ends.

4-19 The length of the peptides bound by MHC class II molecules is not constrained.

4-20 The crystal structures of several peptide:MHC

receptor complexes show a similar orientation of the T-cell receptor over the peptide

complex.

4-21 The CD4 and CD8 cell-surface proteins of T cells directly contact MHC molecules and are required to make an effective response to antigen.

4-22 The two classes of MHC molecules are expressed differentially on cells.

4-23 A distinct subset of T cells bears an alternative receptor made up of γ and δ chains.
