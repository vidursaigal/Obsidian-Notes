4-1 IgG antibodies consist of four polypeptide chains.

4-2 Immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are composed of constant and variable regions.

4-3 The domains of an immunoglobulin molecule have similar structures.

4-4 The antibody molecule can readily be cleaved into functionally distinct fragments.

4-5 The hinge region of the immunoglobulin molecule allows flexibility in binding to multiple antigens.
- Glycoproteins on virus are very sparsely separated, fab of antibody is not enough to link two glycoprotein on surface of virus 
- Hinges of fc and fab region are flexible, allowing 60 degree angles and 90 degree angles.

4-6 Different classes of immunoglobulins are distinguished by the structure of their heavy-chain constant regions.

- Placenta is tightly regulated between fetus and mother, so antibody of small size can be transferred, not the IgM pentamer
- J chain, easier to transfer from mucosal and gut regions 
- Fc receptor is small, it only has two immunoglobulin domains Fab has to bend down so that the fc receptor can

4-7 The constant region confers functional specialization on the antibody.

4-8 IgM and IgA can form polymers by interacting with the J chain.
