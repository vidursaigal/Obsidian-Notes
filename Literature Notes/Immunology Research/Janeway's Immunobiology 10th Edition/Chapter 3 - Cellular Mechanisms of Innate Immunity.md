# Chapter Introduction

In **Chapter 2**, we explored the body's **innate defenses**, which act immediately to protect against infection. These defenses include:
- **Epithelial barriers** that prevent pathogen entry.
- **Secreted antimicrobial proteins** that inhibit microbial growth.
- The **complement system**, which identifies and marks pathogens for destruction.

Beneath the epithelial surfaces lie **phagocytic cells** (such as macrophages and neutrophils) that are ready to engulf and destroy invading microorganisms. These phagocytes:
- Recognize microbes flagged by complement proteins.
- Trigger the next phase of defense—**induced innate immune response**—which leads to **inflammation** and recruits additional immune cells and molecules to the site of infection.

In this chapter, we dive deeper into:
- How **phagocytic cells** detect microbes and cellular damage.
- The mechanisms by which they **destroy pathogens**.
- Their role in orchestrating **inflammatory responses** through the release of **cytokines** and **chemokines**.

We will also explore the roles of **innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**, including **natural killer (NK) cells**, which contribute to host defenses against **viruses** and other intracellular pathogens. Additionally, **dendritic cells** initiate the **adaptive immune response**, bridging innate and adaptive immunity.

# Pathogen Recognition by Cells of the Innate Immune System

The innate immune system, while not as specific as the adaptive immune system, has evolved to recognize conserved molecular patterns shared by pathogens, known as **pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)**. These PAMPs are recognized by **pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)**, which are genetically encoded and passed down through evolution, allowing the immune system to identify a broad spectrum of pathogens. The recognition of pathogens by PRRs is nonclonal, meaning that multiple cells express these receptors, allowing for a rapid response to infection.

## 3-1. Microbes Are Recognized, Ingested, and Killed by Phagocytes

Once a microorganism crosses epithelial barriers, **resident phagocytes** such as **macrophages** and **neutrophils** quickly recognize and engulf the invader. Macrophages are distributed throughout tissues and can originate from embryonic progenitors or circulating monocytes. Neutrophils are recruited from the bloodstream during infections and are particularly potent in ingesting and killing pathogens. The process of **phagocytosis** involves:
1. **Recognition** of the pathogen by PRRs on phagocytes.
2. **Engulfment** into a vesicle called a **phagosome**.
3. Fusion of the phagosome with a **lysosome** to form a **phagolysosome**, where the pathogen is destroyed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides.

Macrophages and neutrophils express various receptors, such as **C-type lectins** (e.g., Dectin-1) and **scavenger receptors**, that detect microbial components and trigger the engulfing of pathogens. **Complement receptors** and **Fc receptors** also aid in phagocytosis by binding to complement-coated microbes and antibodies.

## 3-2. G Protein-Coupled Receptors Link Microbe Recognition to Intracellular Killing

Phagocytes also express **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)** that enhance antimicrobial responses. For example, the **fMLF receptor** detects bacterial polypeptides, while the **C5a receptor** responds to complement fragments. These receptors:
- Trigger intracellular signaling that leads to chemotaxis, guiding phagocytes to infection sites.
- Activate the production of **ROS** and other microbicidal agents inside phagosomes, boosting the killing of engulfed pathogens.

The activation of **NADPH oxidase** in the phagosome membrane leads to the generation of ROS, a process known as the **respiratory burst**. This mechanism helps macrophages and neutrophils efficiently kill microbes within the phagolysosome.

## 3-3. Microbial Recognition and Tissue Damage Initiate an Inflammatory Response

When macrophages recognize microbes or detect tissue damage, they release **cytokines** and **chemokines**, signaling molecules that initiate **inflammation**. Inflammation serves three main functions:
1. **Recruitment** of additional immune cells and proteins to the infection site.
2. **Formation of blood clots** to limit pathogen spread.
3. **Tissue repair** once the infection is cleared.

Inflammatory responses are characterized by **heat, pain, redness, and swelling** due to increased blood flow, vascular permeability, and the migration of immune cells like neutrophils. Inflammatory mediators such as **prostaglandins**, **leukotrienes**, and **TNF-α** further amplify the response by activating endothelial cells and promoting leukocyte extravasation (migration from blood into tissues).

## 3-4. Toll-like Receptors Represent an Ancient Pathogen-Recognition System

The discovery of **Toll-like receptors (TLRs)** in **Drosophila** and their role in host defense laid the foundation for understanding **pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)** in mammals. TLRs detect conserved microbial features and initiate immune responses. The first mammalian TLR discovered was **TLR-4**, which recognizes **lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** from Gram-negative bacteria. The evolutionary importance of TLRs is underscored by their ability to detect pathogens across diverse species.

## 3-5. Mammalian Toll-like Receptors Are Activated by Many Different Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns

Mammals express a variety of **TLRs** that detect different **PAMPs** from bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. These include:
- **TLR-2**: Recognizes lipoteichoic acids and diacyl lipopeptides from Gram-positive bacteria.
- **TLR-3**: Detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from viruses.
- **TLR-4**: Recognizes LPS from Gram-negative bacteria.
- **TLR-5**: Detects bacterial flagellin.
- **TLR-9**: Recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA from bacteria and viruses.

TLRs can be located on the cell surface (e.g., TLR-4 and TLR-5) or in **endosomes** (e.g., TLR-3 and TLR-9), enabling them to detect pathogens both outside and inside cells. The interaction of TLRs with their ligands leads to **dimerization** and activation of signaling pathways that trigger inflammatory and immune responses, thus playing a crucial role in the body's defense against infection.

## 3-6. TLR-4 Recognizes Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide in Association with the Host Accessory Proteins MD-2 and CD14

**TLR-4**, primarily expressed by dendritic cells and macrophages, plays a pivotal role in sensing **lipopolysaccharide (LPS)** from **Gram-negative bacteria**. TLR-4 forms a complex with the accessory protein **MD-2**, which assists in LPS recognition and proper TLR-4 localization to the cell surface. The interaction between TLR-4 and MD-2 allows the **LPS molecule** to insert five of its lipid chains into a hydrophobic pocket of MD-2, while a sixth lipid chain binds directly to a second TLR-4 monomer, inducing **TLR-4 dimerization** and initiating signaling.

In addition to MD-2, **LPS-binding protein** and **CD14** contribute to LPS detection by transferring LPS from bacterial membranes to the TLR-4:MD-2 complex. CD14 serves both as a phagocytic receptor and as an accessory to TLR-4 in **macrophages and dendritic cells**. This system is critical in controlling bacterial infections but can also lead to **septic shock** if LPS triggers excessive cytokine production, leading to systemic inflammation and circulatory collapse.

## 3-7. TLRs Activate NFκB, AP-1, and IRF Transcription Factors to Induce the Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines and Type I Interferons

TLR signaling activates a cascade of intracellular pathways that induce the production of **inflammatory cytokines** and **type I interferons**. Upon ligand binding, TLRs dimerize, and their **TIR domains** recruit adaptor molecules like **MyD88**, **TRIF**, **MAL**, and **TRAM**, depending on the specific TLR. The adaptors determine which downstream pathways are activated, primarily resulting in the activation of **NFκB**, **AP-1**, and **IRF transcription factors**.

- **MyD88-dependent signaling** leads to the activation of **NFκB**, which promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like **TNF-α**, **IL-1β**, and **IL-6**.
- **TRIF-dependent signaling**, primarily utilized by **TLR-3** and **TLR-4**, activates **IRF3** and **IRF7**, leading to the production of **type I interferons** (IFN-α and IFN-β) essential for antiviral responses.
  
The activation of these pathways is crucial for orchestrating immune responses to both bacterial and viral pathogens.

## 3-8. The RIG-I–Like Receptors Detect Cytoplasmic Viral RNAs and Activate MAVS to Induce Type I Interferon Production and Pro-inflammatory Cytokines

The **RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs)** detect **cytoplasmic viral RNA** and are essential for the innate immune response to RNA viruses. **RIG-I** and **MDA-5**, key members of the RLR family, recognize viral **double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)** and initiate signaling through the adaptor protein **MAVS** on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RLRs aggregate and recruit MAVS, leading to the activation of **TBK1** and **IRF3**, which promote the production of **type I interferons**. The RLR pathway complements TLR signaling in recognizing viruses, especially those replicating in the cytoplasm.

## 3-9. Cytosolic DNA Activates the cGAS–STING Pathway to Induce Production of Type I Interferons

**Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)** is the key sensor of **cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)**, particularly during viral infections. Upon binding to cytosolic DNA, cGAS produces **cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP)**, which binds to and activates the **STING** protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Activated STING recruits **TBK1**, which phosphorylates **IRF3**, leading to **type I interferon production**. This pathway plays a crucial role in the immune response to DNA viruses and certain intracellular bacteria that release DNA into the cytosol.

## 3-10. NLRs Comprise a Large Family of Intracellular Sensors with Diverse Functions

The **NOD-like receptors (NLRs)** are intracellular sensors that recognize **bacterial peptidoglycans** and activate **NFκB** to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines. **NOD1** detects **γ-glutamyl diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP)**, a component of Gram-negative bacteria, while **NOD2** senses **muramyl dipeptide (MDP)** from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. When activated, NOD1 and NOD2 recruit **RIP2** kinase, leading to the formation of a polyubiquitin scaffold that recruits and activates **TAK1** and **IKK**, resulting in **NFκB activation**.

NOD2 plays a special role in **intestinal immunity**, and mutations in NOD2 are linked to **Crohn’s disease**, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Gain-of-function mutations in NOD2 can also lead to other inflammatory disorders, such as **Blau syndrome**.

## 3-11. Certain NLR Proteins React to Infection or Cellular Damage by Forming an Inflammasome that Induces Cell Death and Secretion of Inflammatory Cytokines

Some **NLR proteins** respond to infection or cellular damage by forming a multiprotein complex called an **inflammasome**, which activates inflammatory **caspases** such as **caspase 1**. Activated caspase 1 cleaves pro-inflammatory cytokines **IL-1β** and **IL-18**, releasing them in their active forms. Caspase 1 also cleaves **gasdermin D**, a cytosolic protein that forms pores in the plasma membrane, leading to the release of IL-1β and IL-18, and initiating a lytic form of cell death called **pyroptosis**. Pyroptosis is a host defense mechanism that exposes intracellular pathogens to the immune system.

Certain NLR proteins serve as **pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)** by inducing inflammasome formation in response to direct binding of pathogen-derived molecules. For instance, **NAIPs (NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory proteins)** detect bacterial proteins in the cytosol and interact with **NLRC4** to form an inflammasome. **NAIP5** recognizes bacterial **flagellin**, while **NAIP1** and **NAIP2** recognize subunits of the bacterial **type III secretion system (T3SS)**.

In contrast to NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasomes, **NLRP3** detects various signs of cellular stress, such as reduced potassium levels, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), or lysosomal damage, to trigger inflammasome assembly. This broad sensing capability allows NLRP3 to respond to diverse infection signals. NLRP3 activates the inflammasome by interacting with the **ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD)** adaptor protein, which recruits and activates caspase 1.

The inflammasome's role in host defense is critical, but inappropriate inflammasome activation can lead to inflammatory diseases such as **gout** and **hereditary periodic fever syndromes**.

## 3-12. Activation of Innate Sensors in Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Triggers Changes in Gene Expression that Have Far-Reaching Effects on the Immune Response

Activation of innate sensing pathways in **macrophages** and **dendritic cells** leads to changes in gene expression, which enhances both innate and adaptive immune responses. One key outcome is the induction of **co-stimulatory molecules** such as **CD80** and **CD86** on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells, which are crucial for activating **T cells** and initiating adaptive immunity.

When macrophages or dendritic cells recognize pathogens, they express these co-stimulatory molecules and migrate to **lymph nodes**, where they present antigens to T cells and provide the necessary signals to fully activate them. This process is essential for linking the innate and adaptive immune systems and ensuring an appropriate immune response.

## 3-13. Toll Signaling in Drosophila is Downstream of a Distinct Set of Pathogen-Recognition Molecules

In **Drosophila**, the **Toll** receptor is crucial for defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens, but it does not function as a **pattern recognition receptor (PRR)**. Instead, it operates downstream of other proteins that detect pathogens. **Peptidoglycan-recognition proteins (PGRPs)** bind bacterial cell wall components, while **Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs)** recognize specific pathogen molecules such as **LPS** and **β-glucans**.

These recognition proteins activate a proteolytic cascade, resulting in the cleavage of **Spätzle**, which then binds to and activates the Toll receptor. This activation triggers signaling that leads to the production of **antimicrobial peptides** via a pathway similar to the **NFκB** pathway in mammals.

## 3-14. TLR and NOD Genes Have Undergone Extensive Diversification in Both Invertebrates and Some Primitive Chordates

In some organisms, especially invertebrates like the sea urchin **Strongylocentrotus purpuratus**, genes encoding **TLRs**, **NOD-like receptors (NLRs)**, and **scavenger receptors** have undergone significant diversification. The sea urchin genome contains 222 different TLR genes and more than 200 NLR and scavenger receptor genes. 

This expansion suggests a highly diversified **innate immune system** in these organisms, which allows for a broader range of pathogen recognition. Similarly, primitive chordates, such as **amphioxus**, possess a large repertoire of TLRs and NLRs, indicating that innate immunity in these organisms is more complex than in vertebrates.

## Summary

Innate immune cells express multiple receptor systems that recognize microbial patterns and initiate immediate defense mechanisms. **Toll-like receptors (TLRs)**, **RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs)**, **cGAS-STING**, and **NOD-like receptors (NLRs)** play pivotal roles in detecting pathogens and activating downstream signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons. 

**Inflammasomes** formed by NLR proteins activate caspase 1, leading to the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 and the induction of **pyroptosis**, a form of cell death that exposes intracellular pathogens to immune cells. Inappropriate activation of these pathways can result in autoinflammatory diseases, while the adaptive immune response is enhanced through the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules in response to pathogen recognition.

## Consequences of Innate Immune Activation 

In this section, we will examine the responses of **innate immunity** that are induced as an immediate consequence of pathogen recognition by innate immune sensors. We will focus on the major **phagocytes**—**neutrophils**, **macrophages**, and **dendritic cells**—and the cytokines they produce that induce and maintain **inflammation**. The sections below introduce key cytokine families, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and their role in coordinating cellular responses, promoting inflammation, and recruiting immune cells to infection sites.

## 3-15 Cytokines and Their Receptors Fall into Distinct Families of Structurally Related Proteins

Cytokines are small proteins released by cells in response to stimuli, playing a critical role in immune responses. They act by binding to specific receptors and can function in autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Many cytokines are categorized as **interleukins (IL)**, though not all follow this naming convention.

Cytokines are grouped into structural families, including:
- **IL-1 family**
- **Hematopoietin superfamily**
- **Interferons**
- **TNF family**
- **Chemokines**

The **IL-1 family** includes cytokines like **IL-1α**, **IL-1β**, **IL-18**, and **IL-33**, many of which are produced as inactive **proproteins** and then cleaved to produce mature cytokines. Their receptors share **TIR domains**, similar to those in **TLRs**, signaling through the **NF-κB** pathway. Many cytokine receptors, such as those in the **hematopoietin receptor superfamily**, signal through the **JAK-STAT pathway**.
## 3-16 Cytokine Receptors of the Hematopoietin Superfamily Are Associated with the JAK Family of Tyrosine Kinases, Which Activate STAT Transcription Factors

Cytokine receptors in the **hematopoietin superfamily** are linked with **JAK (Janus kinase)** family proteins, which phosphorylate **STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription)** transcription factors. There are four members of the JAK family: **Jak1**, **Jak2**, **Jak3**, and **Tyk2**, each playing unique roles in immune responses.

The **JAK-STAT pathway** is initiated when cytokines bind to their receptors, leading to receptor dimerization and activation of JAK kinases. JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor tails, which recruit and activate STAT proteins. Activated STATs form dimers and translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of immune-related genes.
## 3-17 Chemokines Released by Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Recruit Effector Cells to Sites of Infection

Chemokines are a subset of cytokines responsible for **chemotaxis**—the movement of immune cells to infection sites. **Macrophages** and **dendritic cells** secrete chemokines like **CXCL8 (IL-8)** and **CCL2 (MCP-1)**, which recruit **neutrophils** and **monocytes** from the bloodstream to areas of infection.

Chemokines act through **G protein-coupled receptors** on leukocytes and guide these cells by creating a **chemokine gradient** that directs them to infection sites. Chemokine signaling also enhances immune cell adhesion and prepares leukocytes to fight pathogens upon arrival.
## 3-18 Cell-Adhesion Molecules Control Interactions Between Leukocytes and Endothelial Cells During an Inflammatory Response

During inflammation, **cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs)** on endothelial cells mediate the movement of phagocytes into infected tissues. Three major families of CAMs involved in this process are:
- **Selectins**: initiate leukocyte rolling along the endothelial surface.
- **Integrins**: promote stronger adhesion and eventual extravasation.
- **Immunoglobulin superfamily proteins**: bind to integrins to mediate adhesion.

Selectins like **P-selectin** and **E-selectin** bind to carbohydrate ligands on leukocytes, while integrins such as **LFA-1** and **CR3** interact with **ICAM-1** and **ICAM-2** to mediate firm adhesion and extravasation of immune cells.
## 3-19 Neutrophils Make Up the First Wave of Cells That Cross the Blood Vessel Wall to Enter an Inflamed Tissue

Neutrophils are the first immune cells to respond to infection by migrating from the bloodstream into inflamed tissues, a process called **extravasation**. This involves a multistep process:
1. **Rolling**: mediated by selectins binding to leukocytes.
2. **Tight binding**: involving integrin-ICAM interactions.
3. **Diapedesis**: neutrophils squeeze between endothelial cells to enter tissues.
4. **Migration**: guided by chemokine gradients, neutrophils move to the infection site to perform phagocytosis.
## 3-20 TNF-α is an Important Cytokine That Triggers Local Containment of Infection but Induces Shock When Released Systemically

**TNF-α** plays a central role in controlling local infections by inducing endothelial adhesion molecules and promoting clot formation in local vessels, which contain the infection. However, when TNF-α is released systemically, as during **sepsis**, it can cause **septic shock**, characterized by:
- **Vasodilation** and **increased vascular permeability**.
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**, leading to depletion of clotting factors and multiple organ failure.

## 3-21 Cytokines Made by Macrophages and Dendritic Cells Induce a Systemic Reaction Known as the Acute-Phase Response

Cytokines like **TNF-α**, **IL-1β**, and **IL-6** trigger the **acute-phase response**, a systemic reaction that involves the liver producing **acute-phase proteins** such as:
- **C-reactive protein (CRP)**: binds pathogens and activates the complement system.
- **Mannose-binding lectin (MBL)**: also an opsonin that activates the lectin pathway of complement.
- **Serum amyloid protein (SAP)** and **fibrinogen**: contribute to immune defense.

These proteins mimic antibodies and enhance pathogen clearance by **opsonization** and complement activation.
## 3-22 Interferons Induced by Viral Infection Make Several Contributions to Host Defense

**Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β)** are critical in antiviral immunity. They are produced in response to viral infection and induce an **antiviral state** in nearby cells by:
- Activating **interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)**.
- Enhancing **MHC class I expression** to promote recognition of infected cells by **CD8 T cells**.
- Activating **NK cells** to kill virus-infected cells.

Interferons also induce the production of antiviral proteins such as **Mx proteins** and **PKR**, which inhibit viral replication by degrading viral RNA and inhibiting protein synthesis.
## 3-23 Several Types of Innate Lymphoid Cells Provide Protection in Early Infection

**Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**, including **NK cells**, play crucial roles in early defense against infection. **ILCs** are classified into three groups:
1. **Group 1 ILCs** (e.g., **NK cells**, **ILC1s**): produce **IFN-γ** and defend against viruses and intracellular pathogens.
2. **Group 2 ILCs**: produce **IL-5** and **IL-13**, contributing to parasite defense and tissue repair.
3. **Group 3 ILCs**: produce **IL-17** and **IL-22**, which enhance defenses against extracellular bacteria and fungi.

ILCs respond rapidly to cytokines and help amplify the innate immune response during infection.
## 3-24 NK Cells Are Activated by Type I Interferon and Macrophage-Derived Cytokines

**Natural killer (NK) cells** are early responders to viral infections. Activated by **IFN-α**, **IFN-β**, and **IL-12**, NK cells kill virus-infected cells by releasing **cytotoxic granules** containing **perforin** and **granzymes**, which induce apoptosis in the target cells.

NK cells also express **TRAIL**, a ligand that triggers **apoptosis** through **death receptors** (DR4 and DR5) on infected cells. NK cells serve to contain infections until the adaptive immune response is fully activated.

## 3-25 NK Cells Express Activating and Inhibitory Receptors to Distinguish Between Healthy and Infected Cells

**NK cells** use a balance of **activating** and **inhibitory receptors** to distinguish between healthy and infected or transformed cells. **Inhibitory receptors**, such as those recognizing **MHC class I** molecules, prevent NK cells from attacking normal cells.

When MHC class I expression is reduced, as during viral infection or transformation, NK cells are activated via **stress-induced ligands**. **Activating receptors**, such as **NKG2D**, recognize stress-induced molecules on infected cells, leading to NK-cell activation and target cell killing.
## 3-26 NK-Cell Receptors Belong to Several Structural Families

NK-cell receptors are categorized into two major families:
- **Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs)**: recognize MHC class I molecules and can be activating or inhibitory.
- **Killer cell lectin-like receptors (KLRs)**: such as **NKG2D**, recognize stress-induced ligands and promote cytotoxicity.

These receptors regulate NK-cell activity, with **ITIM**-containing inhibitory receptors preventing activation and **ITAM**-associated activating receptors promoting NK-cell cytotoxic functions.
## 3-27 NK Cells Express Activating Receptors That Recognize Ligands Induced on Infected Cells or Tumor Cells

**Activating receptors** on NK cells, such as **NKG2D** and **natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs)**, recognize stress-induced ligands like **MIC-A** and **MIC-B** on infected or transformed cells. These receptors signal NK cells to release cytotoxic granules, killing the target cell.

NK cells are critical in controlling viral infections and early tumor surveillance by recognizing and eliminating cells that display signs of infection or transformation.

## Chapter 3 Summary

Innate immunity employs a variety of effector mechanisms to detect infections and eliminate pathogens or contain them until the adaptive immune system can respond. These mechanisms rely on **germline-encoded receptors** found on multiple types of immune cells, which can identify microbial molecules or detect pathogen-induced changes in host cells. Once the initial barriers—such as **epithelia** and **soluble antimicrobial molecules**—are breached, key defenses are mounted by **macrophages** and **tissue-resident cells** like **dendritic cells** and **innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**.

**Macrophages** play a dual role, offering both immediate cellular defense through **phagocytosis** and **antimicrobial actions**, as well as activating **inflammation**, which recruits additional immune cells to infection sites. **Innate immune sensors** trigger signaling pathways that produce **pro-inflammatory** and **antiviral cytokines**, which amplify innate defenses and help initiate adaptive immune responses.

Ongoing research continues to uncover pathogen-sensing mechanisms, providing insights into **autoinflammatory conditions** such as **lupus**, **Crohn’s disease**, and **gout**. This chapter highlights the double-edged nature of innate immunity—while it is crucial for infection control, its effector mechanisms, particularly cytokines like **TNF-α**, can be harmful if dysregulated or released systemically.

Ultimately, innate immunity functions as the first line of defense, often preventing infections from taking hold. When it cannot fully eliminate pathogens, it plays a critical role in activating the **adaptive immune system**, a vital component of human defense against infections.
