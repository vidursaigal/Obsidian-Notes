3-1 After entering tissues, many microbes are recognized, ingested, and killed by phagocytes.

**Phagocytosis Process**: The right section describes the process of phagocytosis, where macrophages internalize pathogens like bacteria and yeast:

- The macrophage engulfs the bacterium and yeast, forming a **phagosome**.
- This phagosome then fuses with lysosomes, creating a **phagolysosome** where the engulfed material is broken down.

3-2 G protein–coupled receptors on phagocytes link microbe recognition with increased efficiency of intracellular killing.

On exam 
- Features -Receptor-ligand binding, Conformational changes of proteins, Cycling of gtp-gdp 
- Alpha subunit is a guanine nucleotide exhchange
### Step 1: Ligand Binding

- **Before Binding:** The GPCR is inactive and not associated with a G protein. It has GDP (inactive form) bound to the alpha subunit.
- **Action:** A ligand (like a chemokine or fMet-Leu-Phe) binds to the GPCR, causing a change in the receptor's shape.

### Step 2: Conformational Change

- **Change Triggered:** The binding of the ligand causes a conformational change in the GPCR, enabling it to interact with the G protein.
- **Exchange of Nucleotides:** The G protein releases GDP and binds GTP (active form).

### Step 3: G Protein Activation

- **Dissociation:** The G protein dissociates into two subunits: the alpha (α) subunit and the beta-gamma (βγ) complex.
- **Activation of Proteins:** Both subunits can now activate other target proteins involved in signaling pathways.

### Step 4: Biological Responses

- **GTPase Activity:** The α subunit, with GTP bound, activates specific GTPases (like Rac and Rho), leading to cellular responses such as chemotaxis (movement toward the ligand) and respiratory burst (a rapid release of reactive oxygen species).

### Step 5: Termination of Signaling

- **Cleavage of GTP:** The α subunit hydrolyzes GTP to GDP, returning to its inactive form.
- **Reassociation:** The α subunit can then reassociate with the βγ complex, re-forming the inactive G protein, ready for another cycle.

- **Neutrophil Engulfment**:
    
    - Neutrophils recognize and bind to bacteria.
    - Bacterial peptides (such as **fMet-Leu-Phe**) activate a molecule called **Rac**, which helps in forming the phagosome—a vesicle that engulfs the bacteria.
- **Phagosome Formation**:
    
    - Once the bacteria are inside the neutrophil, they are enclosed in a phagosome.
    - The phagosome then fuses with granules (primary and secondary), which contain enzymes, and a lysosome.
- **Activation of NADPH Oxidase**:
    
    - This fusion activates **NADPH oxidase**, an enzyme complex that helps produce **reactive oxygen species (ROS)**, like **O₂⁻** (superoxide), which are toxic to bacteria.
- **Acidification**:
    
    - The inside of the phagosome becomes acidic due to ion (K⁺) influx, which releases granule enzymes like **cathepsin G** and **elastase** to break down the bacteria.
- **Killing of Bacteria**:
    
    - ROS, along with enzymes, degrade the bacteria. Additional molecules like **H₂O₂ (hydrogen peroxide)** and **OCl⁻ (hypochlorous acid)** are produced to destroy the bacteria effectively.

- **Monocyte Binding and Activation**:
    
    - Monocytes in the bloodstream recognize and bind to adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells lining blood vessels near the site of infection.
    - The monocytes receive signals from **chemokines**, which are signaling molecules secreted by infected or damaged tissues.
- **Monocyte Migration**:
    
    - Once activated, the monocyte's integrins (e.g., **ICAM-1**) bind tightly to adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells.
    - This binding allows the monocyte to migrate through the blood vessel wall in a process called **extravasation**, where the monocyte leaves the bloodstream and enters the surrounding tissue.
- **Differentiation into Inflammatory Monocytes**:
    
    - After migrating into the tissue, the monocytes differentiate into **inflammatory monocytes** or macrophages.
    - These cells help to fight infections by engulfing and digesting pathogens, and by signaling other immune cells to the site of infection.

Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy leverages the ability of NK cells to identify and eliminate tumor cells that lack the expression of inhibitory ligands, such as MHC class I molecules. NK cells possess both activating and inhibitory receptors, and their function is tightly regulated by the balance between signals from these receptors. If a cell does not present sufficient inhibitory signals (e.g., low or absent MHC class I), NK cells are activated to kill the target.

However, cancer cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to escape NK cell-mediated killing, even when they downregulate inhibitory signals. Here are some key reasons why cancer can escape NK cell immunity:
