3-1 After entering tissues, many microbes are recognized, ingested, and killed by phagocytes.

**Phagocytosis Process**: The right section describes the process of phagocytosis, where macrophages internalize pathogens like bacteria and yeast:

- The macrophage engulfs the bacterium and yeast, forming a **phagosome**.
- This phagosome then fuses with lysosomes, creating a **phagolysosome** where the engulfed material is broken down.

3-2 G protein–coupled receptors on phagocytes link microbe recognition with increased efficiency of intracellular killing.

3-3 Microbial recognition and tissue damage initiate an inflammatory response.

3-4 Toll-like receptors represent an ancient pathogen-recognition system.

3-5 Mammalian Toll-like receptors are activated by many different pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

3-6 TLR-4 recognizes bacterial lipopolysaccharide in association with the host accessory proteins MD-2 and CD14.

3-7 TLRs activate NFκB, AP-1, and IRF transcription factors to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons.

3-8 The RIG-I–like receptors detect cytoplasmic viral RNAs and activate MAVS to induce type I interferon production and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

3-9 Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS–STING pathway to induce production of type I interferons.

3-10 NLRs comprise a large family of intracellular sensors with diverse functions.

3-11 Certain NLR proteins react to infection or cellular damage by forming an inflammasome that induces cell death and secretion of inflammatory cytokines.

3-12 Activation of innate sensors in macrophages and dendritic cells triggers changes in gene expression that have far-reaching effects on the immune response.

3-13 Toll signaling in Drosophila is downstream of a distinct set of pathogen-recognition molecules.

3-14 TLR and NOD genes have undergone extensive diversification in both invertebrates and some primitive chordates.
