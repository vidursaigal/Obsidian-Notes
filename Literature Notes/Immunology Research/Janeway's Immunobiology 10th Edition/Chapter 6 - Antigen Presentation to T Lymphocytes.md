# Antigen Presentation to T Lymphocytes

## Section 6-1: The generation of αβ T-cell receptor ligands
- T cells recognize antigens displayed by MHC complexes on cell surfaces.
- Peptide antigens are generated from proteins during antigen processing and loaded onto MHC molecules for antigen presentation.
- Antigens derived from intracellular pathogens and the normal turnover of self-proteins can be presented by MHC molecules.
- MHC class I presents peptides to CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells).
- MHC class II presents peptides to CD4+ T cells (helper T cells).

## Section 6-2: Antigen presentation functions both in arming effector T cells and in triggering their effector functions to attack pathogen-infected cells
- MHC class I molecules present peptides from cytosolic pathogens to CD8 T cells.
- MHC class II molecules present peptides from extracellular or intravesicular pathogens to CD4 T cells.
- Dendritic cells activate naive T cells by presenting peptide:MHC complexes.
- Some pathogens evade immune responses by inhibiting the generation of peptide:MHC complexes.

## Section 6-3: Peptides are generated from ubiquitinated proteins in the cytosol by the proteasome
- Cytosolic proteins are tagged for degradation by ubiquitin.
- Proteasomes degrade these proteins into peptides.
- The proteasome can also splice peptides, generating novel peptide sequences.
- The immunoproteasome is induced by interferons and alters the specificity of peptide generation for MHC class I presentation.

## Section 6-4: Peptides from the cytosol are transported by TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum and further processed before binding to MHC class I molecules
- TAP proteins transport cytosolic peptides into the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules.
- TAP mutations lead to defects in antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules.
- ERAAP further processes peptides for optimal MHC class I binding.

## Section 6-5: Dendritic cells use cross-presentation to present exogenous proteins on MHC class I molecules so as to prime CD8 T cells
- Cross-presentation allows dendritic cells to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules.
- This process is critical for activating CD8 T cells in response to viruses and tumors.
- The cDC1 dendritic cell lineage specializes in cross-presentation.

## Section 6-6: Peptide:MHC class II complexes are generated in acidified endocytic vesicles from proteins obtained through endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy
- MHC class II molecules bind peptides in endocytic vesicles.
- Proteins from extracellular or intravesicular pathogens are degraded in acidic vesicles.
- Proteases, such as cathepsins, process these proteins for MHC class II presentation.
- Autophagy delivers cytosolic proteins to the vesicular system for MHC class II presentation.

## Section 6-7: The invariant chain directs newly synthesized MHC class II molecules to acidified intracellular vesicles
- The invariant chain (Ii) blocks the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules, preventing premature peptide binding.
- Ii targets MHC class II molecules to acidic endosomes where proteases degrade Ii, leaving the CLIP fragment bound to the MHC class II molecule.
- This ensures that MHC class II molecules only bind peptides in the proper compartment.

## Section 6-8: The MHC class II–like molecules HLA-DM and HLA-DO regulate exchange of CLIP for other peptides
- HLA-DM facilitates the release of CLIP from MHC class II molecules, allowing antigenic peptides to bind.
- HLA-DM stabilizes the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules.
- HLA-DO acts as a negative regulator of HLA-DM and is involved in regulating peptide editing.

## Section 6-9: Cessation of MHC class II antigen processing occurs after dendritic-cell activation through reduced expression of the MARCH-1 E3 ligase
- Inactivated dendritic cells express MARCH-1, which ubiquitinates MHC class II molecules, leading to their degradation.
- Upon activation, dendritic cells reduce MARCH-1 expression, prolonging the lifetime of peptide:MHC class II complexes on the surface.
- This mechanism ensures that pathogen-derived peptides are presented for longer periods during immune responses.
