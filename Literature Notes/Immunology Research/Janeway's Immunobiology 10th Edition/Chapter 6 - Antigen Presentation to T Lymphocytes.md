# Antigen Presentation to T Lymphocytes

## Section 6-1: The generation of αβ T-cell receptor ligands
- T cells recognize antigens displayed by MHC complexes on cell surfaces.
- Peptide antigens are generated from proteins during antigen processing and loaded onto MHC molecules for antigen presentation.
- Antigens derived from intracellular pathogens and the normal turnover of self-proteins can be presented by MHC molecules.
- MHC class I presents peptides to CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells).
- MHC class II presents peptides to CD4+ T cells (helper T cells).

## Section 6-2: Antigen presentation functions both in arming effector T cells and in triggering their effector functions to attack pathogen-infected cells
- MHC class I molecules present peptides from cytosolic pathogens to CD8 T cells.
- MHC class II molecules present peptides from extracellular or intravesicular pathogens to CD4 T cells.
- Dendritic cells activate naive T cells by presenting peptide:MHC complexes.
- Some pathogens evade immune responses by inhibiting the generation of peptide:MHC complexes.

## Section 6-3: Peptides are generated from ubiquitinated proteins in the cytosol by the proteasome
- Cytosolic proteins are tagged for degradation by ubiquitin.
- Proteasomes degrade these proteins into peptides.
- The proteasome can also splice peptides, generating novel peptide sequences.
- The immunoproteasome is induced by interferons and alters the specificity of peptide generation for MHC class I presentation.

## Section 6-4: Peptides from the cytosol are transported by TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum and further processed before binding to MHC class I molecules
- TAP proteins transport cytosolic peptides into the ER for loading onto MHC class I molecules.
- TAP mutations lead to defects in antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules.
- ERAAP further processes peptides for optimal MHC class I binding.

## Section 6-5: Dendritic cells use cross-presentation to present exogenous proteins on MHC class I molecules so as to prime CD8 T cells
- Cross-presentation allows dendritic cells to present exogenous antigens on MHC class I molecules.
- This process is critical for activating CD8 T cells in response to viruses and tumors.
- The cDC1 dendritic cell lineage specializes in cross-presentation.

## Section 6-6: Peptide:MHC class II complexes are generated in acidified endocytic vesicles from proteins obtained through endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy
- MHC class II molecules bind peptides in endocytic vesicles.
- Proteins from extracellular or intravesicular pathogens are degraded in acidic vesicles.
- Proteases, such as cathepsins, process these proteins for MHC class II presentation.
- Autophagy delivers cytosolic proteins to the vesicular system for MHC class II presentation.

## Section 6-7: The invariant chain directs newly synthesized MHC class II molecules to acidified intracellular vesicles
- The invariant chain (Ii) blocks the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules, preventing premature peptide binding.
- Ii targets MHC class II molecules to acidic endosomes where proteases degrade Ii, leaving the CLIP fragment bound to the MHC class II molecule.
- This ensures that MHC class II molecules only bind peptides in the proper compartment.

## Section 6-8: The MHC class II–like molecules HLA-DM and HLA-DO regulate exchange of CLIP for other peptides
- HLA-DM facilitates the release of CLIP from MHC class II molecules, allowing antigenic peptides to bind.
- HLA-DM stabilizes the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II molecules.
- HLA-DO acts as a negative regulator of HLA-DM and is involved in regulating peptide editing.

## Section 6-9: Cessation of MHC class II antigen processing occurs after dendritic-cell activation through reduced expression of the MARCH-1 E3 ligase
- Inactivated dendritic cells express MARCH-1, which ubiquitinates MHC class II molecules, leading to their degradation.
- Upon activation, dendritic cells reduce MARCH-1 expression, prolonging the lifetime of peptide:MHC class II complexes on the surface.
- This mechanism ensures that pathogen-derived peptides are presented for longer periods during immune responses.

# Notes on Antigen Presentation to T Lymphocytes

## Section 6-10: Many proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation are encoded by genes within the MHC
- The MHC complex, located on chromosome 6 in humans, contains a large number of genes, with many encoding proteins involved in antigen presentation.
- MHC class I and II genes are linked within the MHC and vary between species (e.g., human HLA genes vs. mouse H-2 genes).
- Genes encoding antigen-presentation proteins like β2-microglobulin, invariant chain, TAPBPR, cathepsin S, and MARCH1 are located outside the MHC.
- Key proteins involved in antigen presentation, including TAP and the proteasome components, are encoded within the MHC region, demonstrating the evolutionary importance of antigen presentation.
- The presence of multiple MHC genes in each class allows individuals to present a broader range of peptides for immune responses.

## Section 6-11: The protein products of MHC class I and class II genes are highly polymorphic
- MHC polymorphism means multiple alleles exist for each MHC gene, contributing to diversity in peptide presentation across the population.
- MHC molecules are expressed in a codominant manner, meaning both alleles contribute equally to the pool of MHC proteins on a cell surface.
- The extensive diversity due to polymorphism and polygeny ensures that populations can respond to a wide range of pathogens, making it difficult for pathogens to evade immune detection.
- In fully heterozygous individuals, diversity of MHC class II molecules can increase further through the pairing of different allelic forms of α and β chains.

## Section 6-12: MHC polymorphism affects antigen recognition by T cells by influencing both peptide binding and the contacts between the T-cell receptor and MHC molecule
- MHC polymorphisms are clustered around the peptide-binding groove and areas that make contact with T-cell receptors, influencing both peptide recognition and binding.
- The sequence motifs that define which peptides can bind to specific MHC molecules are altered by polymorphisms in the peptide-binding groove.
- Failures in immune response to particular antigens (Ir gene defects) were observed in inbred animals that lack the diversity in MHC molecules, highlighting the importance of polymorphism.
- The concept of MHC restriction is introduced: T-cell recognition of antigen is restricted to specific MHC alleles, explaining how T cells are limited in recognizing only antigens presented by host MHC molecules.

## Section 6-13: Alloreactive T cells recognizing nonself MHC molecules are very abundant
- T cells exhibit alloreactivity, meaning they can react to nonself MHC molecules, which is particularly important in organ transplantation and tissue rejection.
- About 1-10% of T cells respond to allogeneic MHC molecules, contributing to the strong immune responses seen in transplant rejection.
- This phenomenon is explained by positive selection in the thymus, where T cells are selected for weak interactions with self-MHC molecules, which might cross-react with nonself MHC molecules.
- Crystallographic studies suggest that some T-cell receptor genes inherently possess MHC affinity, explaining why alloreactivity is so common.

## Section 6-14: Many T cells respond to superantigens
- Superantigens are proteins produced by pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses) that stimulate an unusually large number of T cells by binding to both MHC class II molecules and T-cell receptors.
- Unlike normal antigens, superantigens do not need to be processed and can bind directly to MHC class II molecules, outside of the peptide-binding groove.
- Superantigens cause a massive production of cytokines by CD4 T cells, leading to systemic toxicity and suppression of adaptive immunity, aiding pathogen survival.

## Section 6-15: MHC polymorphism extends the range of antigens to which the immune system can respond
- The high level of MHC polymorphism ensures that different individuals can present a wide range of pathogen-derived peptides, increasing the likelihood of mounting an effective immune response.
- Pathogens like Epstein-Barr virus and adenovirus evolve to escape detection by mutating peptides to avoid MHC binding, but the diversity of MHC molecules makes complete immune evasion difficult.
- There is a balance between the number of MHC genes that can increase immune response diversity and the need to maintain self-tolerance by removing autoreactive T cells.

## Summary
- MHC molecules are crucial for presenting pathogen-derived peptides to T cells, with extensive polymorphism ensuring a broad range of peptide-binding specificities.
- The diversity of MHC molecules contributes to individual and population-level immunity, making it harder for pathogens to evade immune detection.
- MHC restriction, superantigen responses, and alloreactivity are key concepts in understanding how MHC molecules mediate immune responses.
- Evolutionary pressures maintain the polymorphism in MHC molecules to ensure effective immune defenses against a wide range of pathogens.
