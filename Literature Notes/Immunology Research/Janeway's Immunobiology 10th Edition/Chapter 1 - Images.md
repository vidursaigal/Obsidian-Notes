-Defensins are small, antimicrobial peptides that play a role in innate immunity and host defense
-Macrophages - A type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and stimulates the action of other immune system cells
-Granulocytes - type of immune cell that has granules (small particles) with enzymes that are released during infections, allergic reactions, and asthma. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes. 
-NK cells contain granules that contain enzymes that can kill cells that are infected with viruses or are tumor cells. They can also detect stressed cells and cells with altered MHC profiles, and destroy them by releasing cytotoxic contents. A subset of large granular lymphocytes.

-Anatomical and chemical barriers are the first defense against pathogens. Innate immune system cells embed in lungs and tissue. 
-Sensor cells express pattern-recognition receptors that provide an initial discrimination between self and non-self.
	-Then, they induce an inflammatory response by producing mediators such as chemokines and cytokines.
-Innate lymphoid cells and natural killer cells are effector cells that share similarities with lymphoid lineages of the adaptive immune system. 
-Commensal (not beneficial or harmful) organisms cause little host damage while pathogens damage host tissues.

-Myeloid lineage = innate immune system

This image shows a macrophage expressing receptors that help it recognize a variety of pathogens, including bacteria (via NOD1, TLR-1/TLR-2, TLR-4), fungi (via glucan receptor), viruses (via mannose receptor), and cellular debris (via scavenger receptor).

Macrophages bring in monocytes and neutrophils from blood via cytokines/chemokines.

- **Hematoxylin** stains cell nuclei a dark blue or purple color, which allows for clear visualization of nuclei and nuclear detail.
- **Eosin** stains the extracellular matrix and cytoplasm a pinkish color, highlighting the overall structure of tissues.

-The interaction of antigens with antigen receptors induces lymphocytes to acquire effector and memory activity. 
![[Pasted image 20241008224919.png]]
-Antibodies and TCRs have constant and variables regions
	-these have different functions
![[Pasted image 20241008225310.png]]
-FcRs recognize the Fc fragment of antibodies and bind to them when they are attached to infected cells or pathogens. This binding activates immune responses that destroy microbes and infected cells.
-Fc receptors, found on the surface of myeloid cells like macrophages and neutrophils, specifically bind to the Fc region (composed of the constant 1 and constant 2 domains) of antibodies, allowing them to capture antibodies in the bloodstream and initiate immune responses against pathogens coated with antibodies.
-Antibodies and TCRs recognize antigens through different mechanisms
![[Pasted image 20241008225950.png]]

-Antigen receptor genes are assembled through rearrangement of incomplete receptor gene fragments.
-Lymphocytes activated by antigen give rise to clones of antigen-specific effector cells that mediate adaptive immunity. 
	-In the immune system, effector cells are the relatively short-lived activated cells that defend the body in an immune response. Effector B cells are called plasma cells and secrete antibodies, and activated T cells include cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells, which carry out cell-mediated responses.

-Lymphocytes with self-reactive receptors are eliminated during development or functionally inactivated
-Lymphocytes mature in the bone marrow or thymus and then congregate in lymphoid tissues throughout the body
![[Pasted image 20241008231313.png]]
-Adaptive immune responses are initiated by antigen and antigen-presenting cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues.
-Lymphocytes encounter and respond to antigen in the peripheral lymphoid organs.

-Mucosal surfaces have specialized structures that orchestrate responses to environmental microbes 
![[Pasted image 20241008231900.png]]
-Lymphocytes activated by antigens proliferate in the peripheral lymphoid organs
	-this then generates effector cells and immunological memory

-Innate immune responses can select from several effector modules to protect against different types of pathogens.

-Antibodies protect against extracellular pathogens and their toxic products. 
-Neutralization:
Neutralizing antibodies bind directly to bacterial toxins or viral particles, blocking their ability to bind to receptors on host cells. This prevents the toxin from entering or affecting the cell.
Example in the image: Antibodies are shown surrounding and neutralizing the bacterial toxin by blocking its active sites.

-Opsonization:
This process involves antibodies coating the surface of bacteria, which tags them for recognition by phagocytic cells (like macrophages).
The bacteria are then engulfed and digested by the macrophages. Even if the antibodies arenâ€™t neutralizing, they can still promote bacterial uptake by macrophages for clearance.
In the image: The antibody binds to the surface of the bacteria, and a macrophage is shown ingesting the coated bacteria.

-Complement Activation:
Antibodies bind to bacteria and recruit the complement system, a group of proteins in the blood that help clear pathogens.
This leads to the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) that punctures the bacterial cell membrane, leading to bacterial lysis and ingestion.
The image shows complement proteins binding to the antibody-pathogen complex and initiating bacterial destruction.

-T cells orchestrate cell-mediated immunity and regulate B-cell responses to most antigens

-Inherited and acquired defects in the immune system result in increases susceptibility to infection. 
-Understanding adaptive immune responses is important for the control of allergies, autoimmune disease, and the rejection of transplanted organs. 
-Vaccination is the most effective means of controlling infectious diseases. 
-Emerging pathogens present new challenges for the immune system
