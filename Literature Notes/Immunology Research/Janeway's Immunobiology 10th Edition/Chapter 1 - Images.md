-Defensins are small, antimicrobial peptides that play a role in innate immunity and host defense
-Macrophages - A type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills microorganisms, removes dead cells, and stimulates the action of other immune system cells
-Granulocytes - type of immune cell that has granules (small particles) with enzymes that are released during infections, allergic reactions, and asthma. Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes. 
-NK cells contain granules that contain enzymes that can kill cells that are infected with viruses or are tumor cells. They can also detect stressed cells and cells with altered MHC profiles, and destroy them by releasing cytotoxic contents. A subset of large granular lymphocytes.

-Anatomical and chemical barriers are the first defense against pathogens. Innate immune system cells embed in lungs and tissue. 
-Sensor cells express pattern-recognition receptors that provide an initial discrimination between self and non-self.
	-Then, they induce an inflammatory response by producing mediators such as chemokines and cytokines.
-Innate lymphoid cells and natural killer cells are effector cells that share similarities with lymphoid lineages of the adaptive immune system. 
-Commensal (not beneficial or harmful) organisms cause little host damage while pathogens damage host tissues.

This image shows a macrophage expressing receptors that help it recognize a variety of pathogens, including bacteria (via NOD1, TLR-1/TLR-2, TLR-4), fungi (via glucan receptor), viruses (via mannose receptor), and cellular debris (via scavenger receptor).

Macrophages bring in monocytes and neutrophils from blood via cytokines/chemokines.

- **Hematoxylin** stains cell nuclei a dark blue or purple color, which allows for clear visualization of nuclei and nuclear detail.
- **Eosin** stains the extracellular matrix and cytoplasm a pinkish color, highlighting the overall structure of tissues.
