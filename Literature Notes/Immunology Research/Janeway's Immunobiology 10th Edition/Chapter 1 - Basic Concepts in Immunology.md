# Immunology Overview

### Early History
- **Edward Jenner** (late 18th century): Credited with the beginning of immunology as a science through his work on smallpox vaccination.
- **Ancient Greece**: Recognized that surviving a disease could confer protection against future infection.
- **Variolation**: 
  - Practiced since at least the 1400s in the Middle East and China.
  - Involved inhalation or transfer of material from smallpox pustules to protect against smallpox.
  - Known to Jenner, who later developed the concept of **vaccination**.
  - **Smallpox eradicated** in the 1980s.

### Discovery of Antibodies and Complement
- **1890s, Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato**: Discovered that serum from animals immune to diphtheria or tetanus contained an ‘antitoxic activity’ (later identified as **antibodies**) that could confer short-term protection.
- **Jules Bordet (1899)**: Discovered **complement**, a serum component that works with antibodies to destroy pathogenic bacteria.

### Adaptive and Innate Immunity
- **Adaptive Immunity**: 
  - Specific response to infection, such as **antibody production** against a particular pathogen.
  - Develops during the individual's lifetime as an adaptation to infection.
- **Innate Immunity**:
  - Known through the work of **Élie Metchnikoff**, who discovered **phagocytosis**.
  - **Macrophages** (phagocytic cells) provide nonspecific defenses by engulfing and digesting microorganisms.
  - Always present, ready to act, unlike adaptive immunity which takes time to develop but is highly specific.

### Antibodies and Antigens
- **Antibodies**: Induced against a vast range of substances called **antigens** (substances that stimulate antibody production).
- **Paul Ehrlich**: Advanced the development of antiserum for diphtheria and standardized therapeutic serums.
- **Antigens**:
  - Substances recognized by the adaptive immune system.
  - Typically proteins, glycoproteins, or polysaccharides from pathogens.
  - Can include diverse structures such as:
    - Metals (e.g., nickel).
    - Drugs (e.g., penicillin).
    - Organic chemicals (e.g., urushiol in poison ivy).

# Origins of Vertebrate Immune Cells

### Overview of Immune System
- The immune system consists of effector cells and molecules that protect the body from infectious agents and toxins.
- Both **innate** and **adaptive** immune responses rely on the activities of **white blood cells (leukocytes)**.
- Most immune cells arise from the **bone marrow**, though some (e.g., **microglia** of the CNS) originate from the **yolk sac** or **fetal liver** during embryonic development.
  - These tissue-resident cells seed tissues before birth and self-renew throughout life.

### Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)
- After birth, all blood cell types (red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes) derive from **hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)** in the bone marrow.
- **HSCs** are pluripotent (or multipotent), meaning they can give rise to all different blood cell types.
- HSCs give rise to two primary lineages:
  1. **Lymphoid lineage** (via common lymphoid progenitor):
     - Gives rise to:
       - **Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**
       - **Natural killer (NK) cells**
       - **T lymphocytes**
       - **B lymphocytes**
     - **T cells** differentiate in the **thymus**; **B cells** differentiate in the **bone marrow**.
     - After antigen exposure, **B cells** become **antibody-secreting plasma cells**, while **T cells** differentiate into various **effector T cells**.
     - **ILCs** and **NK cells** lack antigen specificity.
  2. **Myeloid lineage** (via common myeloid progenitor):
     - Produces:
       - **Monocytes**
       - **Dendritic cells**
       - **Granulocytes** (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils)
       - **Erythrocytes** (red blood cells)
       - **Megakaryocytes** (produce platelets for blood clotting)

### Immune Cell Types
- **T and B Lymphocytes**:
  - Possess antigen receptors.
  - T cells differentiate in the **thymus**; B cells differentiate in the **bone marrow**.
- **Granulocytes**:
  - Include **neutrophils**, **eosinophils**, and **basophils**.
  - Circulate in the blood and contain **cytoplasmic granules**.
  - Also termed **polymorphonuclear leukocytes** due to irregularly shaped nuclei.
- **Dendritic Cells**:
  - Immature dendritic cells are phagocytic and enter tissues, maturing after encountering pathogens.
  - Derived from both **myeloid** and **lymphoid progenitors**.
- **Monocytes**:
  - Enter tissues and differentiate into **macrophages** or **dendritic cells**.
- **Mast Cells**:
  - Enter tissues and complete their maturation there.

### Lymphatic System
- Immune cells circulate through the **bloodstream** and the **lymphatic system**, which transports lymph and immune cells from tissues back into the bloodstream.

# Principles of Innate Immunity

### Overview of Innate Immunity
- **Lymphocytes** are key cells in recognizing and targeting pathogens but require innate immune system involvement to initiate responses.
- Both **innate** and **adaptive immune responses** share many mechanisms to eliminate pathogens.

### 1.1: Pathogens vs. Commensal Organisms
- **Pathogens**: Microorganisms that cause tissue damage (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites).
  - Mechanisms of damage:
    - **Viruses**: Cause lysis of infected cells.
    - **Intracellular bacteria and parasites**: Kill cells directly or via toxins (e.g., **Plasmodium**).
    - **Extracellular bacteria and fungi**: Release toxins that induce **sepsis**.
    - **Parasitic worms (helminths)**: Cause tissue damage by forming cysts.
- **Commensal organisms**: Microbial communities (microbiome) that do not cause host damage, often have symbiotic relationships (e.g., aiding in digestion).

### 1.2: First Line of Defense
- **Anatomic and chemical barriers**: Prevent pathogen exposure via avoidance mechanisms (e.g., **skin**, **mucosal surfaces**, **antimicrobial proteins**).
- If barriers are breached, the **innate immune system** provides immediate resistance using **complement** and **innate cells**.
- **Tolerance**: Mechanisms that reduce tissue damage caused by infections, distinct from **immunological tolerance** which prevents immune response against host tissues.

### 1.3: Activation of the Immune System
- **Inflammatory inducers**: Chemical structures that signal pathogen presence or tissue damage (e.g., **lipopolysaccharides**, **ATP**).
- **Sensor cells** (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells) detect these inducers and produce **inflammatory mediators** like **cytokines** and **chemokines** to propagate immune responses.

### 1.4: Myeloid Lineage and Innate Immune Cells
- **Common myeloid progenitor (CMP)**: Produces most innate immune cells, including:
  - **Macrophages**
  - **Granulocytes** (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils)
  - **Dendritic cells**
  - **Mast cells**
- **Phagocytes**: Cells like **macrophages** and **neutrophils** that engulf and destroy pathogens.
- **Granulocytes**:
  - **Neutrophils**: Key phagocytic cells in innate immunity.
  - **Eosinophils and basophils**: Primarily involved in defense against parasites and allergic responses.

### 1.5: Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs)
- **Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)**: Detect **pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)** unique to microbes (e.g., **mannose-rich oligosaccharides**, **lipopolysaccharides**).
  - Examples of PRRs:
    - **Toll-like receptors (TLRs)**: Detect extracellular PAMPs.
    - **NOD-like receptors (NLRs)**: Sense intracellular bacterial invasion.

### 1.6: Inflammation and Mediators
- Activation of **PRRs** triggers effector functions in sensor cells (e.g., **phagocytosis**, **production of cytokines**).
- **Cytokines**: Secreted proteins that influence the behavior of nearby cells.
- **Chemokines**: Specialized cytokines that attract immune cells to infection sites.
- Inflammatory responses recruit immune cells to infected tissues, characterized by **heat, pain, redness, and swelling**.

### 1.7: Innate Lymphoid Cells and NK Cells
- **Natural Killer (NK) cells**: Large granular lymphocytes of the innate immune system that kill infected cells, especially important in viral infections.
- **Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)**: Related to NK cells, reside in peripheral tissues, and produce mediators of inflammation.

### Summary of Innate Immunity
- **Strategies**: Avoidance, resistance, and tolerance.
- **Anatomic barriers** (e.g., skin, mucosal surfaces) and **chemical barriers** (e.g., complement, antimicrobial proteins) act as the first line of defense.
- If breached, **sensor cells** activate inflammatory responses and recruit **innate immune cells** to eliminate pathogens. Inflammatory mediators help initiate adaptive immunity when needed.

# Principles of Adaptive Immunity

### Overview
- **Lymphocytes** are key players in adaptive immunity, capable of recognizing a vast array of antigens from various pathogens.
- **Immunological memory**: Adaptive immunity provides long-term protection after exposure to pathogens, a process crucial for vaccines and reinfection defense.
- Lymphocytes express highly variable **antigen receptors** that allow specific recognition of foreign antigens.

### 1.8: Activation of Lymphocytes
- Two major types of lymphocytes:
  - **B cells**: Express **B-cell receptors (BCR)** or **membrane immunoglobulin (mIg)**. After activation, B cells differentiate into **plasma cells** that secrete antibodies.
  - **T cells**: Express **T-cell receptors (TCR)**. Differentiate into:
    - **Cytotoxic T cells**: Kill infected cells.
    - **Helper T cells**: Activate B cells and macrophages.
    - **Regulatory T cells**: Suppress immune responses to prevent damage.
- **Naive lymphocytes**: Inactive lymphocytes that have not encountered their specific antigen.
- **Effector lymphocytes**: Activated lymphocytes that can directly respond to pathogens.

### 1.9: Structure of Antibodies and T-Cell Receptors
- **Antibodies (Immunoglobulins)**:
  - Composed of two **heavy chains** and two **light chains**.
  - Each chain has a **constant region** (effector function) and a **variable region** (antigen-binding site).
  - Antibodies have two identical antigen-binding sites.
- **T-cell receptors (TCRs)**:
  - Composed of two chains (α and β) with variable and constant regions.
  - TCRs are not secreted; they remain on the T cell surface to signal T cell activation.

### 1.10: Antigen Recognition
- **Antibodies** recognize **epitopes** on the surface of antigens (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides).
- **T-cell receptors** recognize **peptide epitopes** presented by **MHC molecules** on cell surfaces.
  - MHC I presents intracellular antigens (e.g., viral proteins).
  - MHC II presents extracellular antigens (e.g., bacterial proteins).

### 1.11: Gene Rearrangement and Diversity
- **Antigen receptor diversity** is generated through **somatic gene rearrangements** during B and T cell development.
- The process allows a small number of gene segments to create a vast repertoire of antigen-specific receptors through **combinatorial diversity** and **junctional diversity**.

### 1.12: Clonal Selection
- **Clonal selection theory**:
  - Each lymphocyte bears a unique antigen receptor.
  - Binding of a foreign antigen triggers **clonal expansion**: the proliferation of lymphocytes with identical receptors specific to the antigen.
  - This ensures a targeted and efficient immune response.

### 1.13: Self-Tolerance
- **Self-reactive lymphocytes** (those recognizing self-antigens) are eliminated through mechanisms such as **clonal deletion** and **anergy** to prevent autoimmune reactions.

### 1.14: Lymphocyte Maturation and Recirculation
- **B cells** mature in the **bone marrow**; **T cells** mature in the **thymus**.
- Mature naive lymphocytes circulate through **peripheral lymphoid tissues** (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen) and respond to antigens.

### 1.15: Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)
- **Dendritic cells**, **macrophages**, and **B cells** present antigens to T cells using **MHC molecules**.
- **Dendritic cells** are key in initiating adaptive immune responses by activating T cells.

### 1.16: Peripheral Lymphoid Organs
- **Peripheral lymphoid organs** (e.g., **lymph nodes**, **spleen**) are specialized for trapping antigens and facilitating lymphocyte activation.
- **Lymph nodes** filter antigens from lymph; **spleen** filters blood-borne antigens.
- **Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT)** and **gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT)** protect mucosal surfaces from pathogens.

### 1.17: Mucosal Immunity
- Mucosal surfaces (e.g., **Peyer's patches** in the gut) contain specialized lymphoid tissues that respond to environmental antigens.
- M cells in **Peyer's patches** transport antigens from the gut to immune cells.

### 1.18: Immunological Memory
- After an infection, some lymphocytes differentiate into **memory cells**, which enable faster and more effective responses to subsequent encounters with the same pathogen.
- **Secondary immune responses** are faster and stronger due to memory cells and **affinity maturation** of antibodies.

### Summary of Adaptive Immunity
- **Clonal selection** ensures that only lymphocytes specific to a given antigen are activated, leading to a targeted response.
- **Immunological memory** provides lasting protection against previously encountered pathogens.
- Adaptive immunity involves **B cells** (antibody production) and **T cells** (recognition of MHC-presented antigens).
- Adaptive responses are initiated in **lymphoid organs** and depend on antigen presentation by **APCs**.

- **Antibody functions**:
  1. **Neutralization**: Binding to pathogens/toxins to prevent cell entry.
  2. **Opsonization**: Coating pathogens to enhance phagocytosis via **Fc receptors** on phagocytes.
  3. **Complement Activation**: Antibody-bound pathogens activate the complement system, leading to:
     - Direct lysis of pathogens.
     - Enhanced phagocytosis through **complement receptors**.

### 1.21: T Cells Orchestrate Cell-Mediated Immunity
- **Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+)**:
  - Recognize antigens presented by **MHC Class I** molecules on infected cells.

- **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**:
  - Caused by **HIV-1** and **HIV-2** viruses.
  - Destroys **CD4+ T cells**, dendritic cells, and macrophages.
  - Leads to increased susceptibility to infections normally controlled by these cells.

### 1.23: Misguided Immune Responses
- **Allergy**: Immune response to innocuous substances (allergens).
- **Autoimmune Disease**: Immune response against self-antigens.
- **Graft Rejection**: Immune response against transplanted organs due to differences in **MHC molecules**.
- **Immunosuppressive Treatments**:
  - Generally non-specific, inhibiting all immune responses.
  - Research aims for antigen-specific immunoregulation.
  - Development of **monoclonal antibodies** offers more selective suppression.

### 1.24: Vaccination
- **Vaccination**: Deliberate stimulation of the immune response to provide protection against specific pathogens.
- **Successes**:
  - Eradication or control of diseases like smallpox, diphtheria, polio, and measles.
- **Challenges**:
  - Lack of effective vaccines for many diseases.
