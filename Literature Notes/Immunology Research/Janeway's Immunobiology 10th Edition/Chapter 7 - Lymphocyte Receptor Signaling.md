### **Introduction: T and B Lymphocyte Activation**
- T and B lymphocytes are key cells in the adaptive immune system, each expressing unique antigen receptors.
- After exiting primary lymphoid organs (thymus for T cells, bone marrow for B cells), they circulate and survey antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
- Upon encountering their specific antigen, they activate intracellular signaling pathways, reorganizing their actin cytoskeleton and synthesizing new proteins.
- Naive T and B cells then proliferate and differentiate into effector cells to combat infections.

### **General Principles of Signal Transduction and Propagation**
- Receptors on the cell surface are transmembrane proteins that link external signals to internal biochemical changes.
- Receptor activation leads to phosphorylation, a process where protein kinases add phosphate groups to proteins (on tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues).

---

### **7-1: Transmembrane Receptors and Phosphorylation**
- Protein kinases phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine, serine, or threonine.
- BCRs and TCRs associate with protein tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate intracellular proteins.
- Cytokine receptors often function by receptor clustering and phosphorylation, but antigen receptor signaling requires co-receptors for tyrosine kinase activation.

---

### **7-2: Intracellular Signal Propagation by Multiprotein Complexes**
- Antigen receptor signaling occurs through large multiprotein signaling complexes.
- Specific protein-interaction domains (e.g., SH2, SH3, PH) allow for precise protein-protein interactions.

---

### **7-3: Small G Proteins as Molecular Switches**
- Small GTPases (e.g., Ras, Rac, Rho) act as molecular switches in intracellular signaling pathways.
- They exist in active (GTP-bound) or inactive (GDP-bound) states, with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) facilitating activation.

---

### **7-4: Mechanisms of Membrane Recruitment**
- Signaling proteins are recruited to the membrane via various mechanisms, such as tyrosine phosphorylation or binding to GTPases like Ras.
- Modified membrane lipids (e.g., PIP3) also help recruit signaling proteins to the plasma membrane.

---

### **7-5: Post-Translational Modifications**
- Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate many intracellular signaling events.
- Ubiquitination often terminates signaling, targeting proteins for degradation.

---

### **7-6: Second Messengers**
- Signaling pathways can generate second messengers (e.g., Ca2+, DAG, IP3) to amplify signals and activate diverse target proteins.

---

### **7-7: Antigen Receptor Complexes**
- TCRs and BCRs consist of antigen-binding chains and invariant signaling chains (e.g., CD3 for T cells, Igα/Igβ for B cells).
- These signaling chains contain ITAMs (Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs) that are phosphorylated upon antigen recognition.

---

### **7-8: TCR Signaling and Co-receptor Engagement**
- TCR activation is enhanced by co-receptors (CD4 or CD8), leading to ITAM phosphorylation and recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70.

---

### **7-9: Initiation of TCR Signaling**

---

### **7-10: ZAP-70 Activation**
- ZAP-70 is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs, activated by Lck, and then phosphorylates adaptor proteins like LAT and SLP-76, linking to downstream signaling pathways.

---

### **7-11: ITAMs in Other Receptors**
- ITAMs are also present in other immune receptors (e.g., Fc receptors) and are essential for activating various immune responses.

---

### **7-12: LAT and SLP-76 Signaling Complex**
- Activated ZAP-70 phosphorylates LAT and SLP-76, forming a complex that serves as a scaffold for downstream signaling.
- LAT:Gads:SLP-76 complex links to four essential downstream signaling pathways, including PI 3-kinase activation.

---

### **7-13: Activation of PLC-γ and Production of Second Messengers**
- PLC-γ (phospholipase C-γ) is recruited to the membrane by binding to PIP3 and phosphorylated LAT/SLP-76.
- Activated PLC-γ cleaves PIP2 into DAG and IP3, which activates calcium signaling and recruits signaling proteins for further amplification.

---

## **7-14: Ca2+ Entry Activates the Transcription Factor NFAT**

- T-cell receptor signaling via PLC-γ triggers calcium ion influx into the cytosol.
- Cytosolic Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, forming a complex that activates calcineurin.
- Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, enabling its nuclear entry to activate gene transcription, including IL-2.
- Calcineurin is inhibited by immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, which prevent NFAT activation.

## **7-15: Ras Activation Stimulates MAPK and AP-1 Expression**

- Ras is activated by DAG generated from PLC-γ and GEFs like RasGRP.
- Ras activation is amplified by Sos, which engages active Ras to produce an all-or-nothing response.
- Ras triggers the MAPK cascade, activating Raf, Mek, and Erk.
- Erk phosphorylates transcription factors, resulting in AP-1 formation (composed of Fos and Jun).
- AP-1 contributes to the transcription of IL-2 and cell-cycle proteins.
