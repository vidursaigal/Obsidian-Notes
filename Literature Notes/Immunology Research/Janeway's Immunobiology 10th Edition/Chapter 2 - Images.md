-Epithelial cells and phagocytes produce several kinds of antimicrobial molecules.
![[Pasted image 20241009020336.png]]-Gram-negative bacteria are surrounded by a thin peptidoglycan cell wall, which itself is surrounded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane but are surrounded by layers of peptidoglycan many times thicker than is found in the Gram-negatives.

Different types of epithelium  - skin, bronchial ciliated epithelium, and gut (not sure if we need to know)

- Lysozyme cleaves bonds in the peptidoglycan.
- The bacterial wall structure becomes weakened.
- The lipid bilayer becomes exposed, which eventually compromises the bacterial integrity.

This image provides a visual explanation of the structure and function of defensins, a class of antimicrobial peptides that play a key role in the immune system's defense against microbial pathogens.
### Top Left Image:

- **Human β1-defensin Structure**: This shows the molecular structure of the β1-defensin, where you can see a combination of helices and beta-sheets (secondary structure elements) forming the peptide.
### Top Right Panel: Mechanism of Action

- **Electrostatic attraction and membrane integration**: The illustration shows how the positively charged defensin is attracted to the negatively charged components of a microbial cell membrane. The electric field across the membrane helps guide the defensin peptides into the lipid bilayer, allowing them to insert into the membrane.
- **Pore formation**: After insertion, defensin peptides group together to form pores in the lipid bilayer of microbial cells. This disrupts the membrane, leading to the leakage of cellular contents, which ultimately kills the pathogen.
### Bottom Panel: Activation of Antimicrobial Peptides

- **Proteolytic activation**: Defensins, cathelicidins, and histatins are shown being activated by proteolytic cleavage (cuts) to release the amphipathic (AMPH) antimicrobial region.
- **Types of antimicrobial peptides**:
    1. **α-defensins**: Cleaved from a pro-region to release the active antimicrobial portion.
    2. **β-defensins**: Similarly cleaved to activate the amphipathic region.
    3. **Cathelicidins**: Activated after cleavage of a "cathelin" domain to release the AMPH part.
    4. **RegIII lecticidins**: Proteolysis activates the antimicrobial portion (CTLD/CRD).

-The complement system recognizes features of microbial surfaces and marks them for destruction by coating them with C3b.

-The lectin pathway uses soluble receptors that recognize microbial surfaces to activate the complement cascade

Microbes	use sugar	as	camouflage	because antibodies cannot recognize the underlying protein sequences
	- HIV and influenza are highly glycosylated

-- **Structure**: MBL monomers form **trimeric clusters** of **carbohydrate-recognition domains** (yellow triangle-shaped regions). These clusters are supported by **collagen helices** and **α-helical coiled coils**, which stabilize the structure.
-- **Structure**: Ficolins are structurally similar to MBLs but have **different carbohydrate-binding domains** (purple spheres), known as **fibrinogen domains**. These proteins also have **collagen helices** and **α-helical coiled coils**. (don't know if any of this is very important)

-The classical pathway is initiated by activation of the C1 complex and is homologous to the lectin pathway
![[Pasted image 20241009032802.png]]
-Complement activation is largely confined to the surface on which it is initiated. 

-The alternative pathway is an amplification loop for C3b formation that is accelerated by properdin in the presence of pathogens. 
![[Pasted image 20241009032858.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241009032912.png]]
-Membrane and plasma proteins that regulate the formation and stability of C3 convertases determine the extent of complement activation.
![[Pasted image 20241009033043.png]]
-Complement developed early in the evolution of multicellular organisms

-Surface-bound C3 convertase deposits large numbers of C3b fragments on pathogen surfaces and generates C5 convertase activity. 
![[Pasted image 20241009033322.png]]
-Ingestion of complement-tagged pathogens by phagocytes is mediated by receptors for the bound complement proteins.
![[Pasted image 20241009033412.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241009033434.png]]
-The small fragments of some complement proteins initiate a local inflammatory response. 
![[Pasted image 20241009033551.png]]

-The terminal complement proteins polymerize to form pores in membranes that can kill certain pathogens.
![[Pasted image 20241009033632.png]]

-Complement control proteins regulate all three pathways of complement activation and protect the host from their destructive effects.
![[Pasted image 20241009033709.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241009033720.png]]
-Genetic and acquired disorders in complement regulation can produce various inflammatory conditions.

-Pathogens produce several types of proteins that can inhibit complement activation.
