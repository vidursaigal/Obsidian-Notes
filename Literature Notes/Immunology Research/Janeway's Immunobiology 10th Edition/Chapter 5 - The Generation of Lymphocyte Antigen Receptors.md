### Lymphocyte Antigen Receptor Diversity

Each lymphocyte expresses numerous identical copies of a single **antigen receptor** that has a **unique antigen-binding site**. This **clonal expression** means that each lymphocyte is distinct among the billions present in the human body. Chapter 4 explained the structural features of **immunoglobulins** (on B cells) and **T-cell receptors (TCRs)** (on T cells), both of which are responsible for antigen recognition. The vast diversity of antigen receptors results from **variations in the amino acid sequences** of their **variable regions**.

In **immunoglobulins**, these variable regions consist of the **heavy-chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>)** and **light-chain variable region (V<sub>L</sub>)**, while in **TCRs**, they are the **Vα** and **Vβ** regions. Each of these regions contains three **hypervariable regions** or **complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)**, which form the receptor's antigen-binding site. These CDRs enable **limitless diversity** in antigen specificity (see Section 4-9).

### Gene Rearrangement and the Diversity Puzzle

In the 1960s and 1970s, immunologists realized that the human genome, with its roughly **3 billion nucleotides**, could not directly encode enough genes to account for the observed diversity of antigen receptors. Encoding each unique antibody with its own gene would overwhelm the genome. Instead, the variable regions of antigen receptors are encoded by **gene segments**. These segments are **rearranged** during **lymphocyte development** to form a complete and unique **variable region sequence**.

This process, known as **gene rearrangement**, combines two or three types of **gene segments**, each of which exists in multiple copies in the germline genome. Through this process, each newly formed lymphocyte ends up with a unique combination of gene segments that encode a specific antigen receptor. This mechanism generates the **diverse repertoire** of antigen specificities in **naive B cells** and **T cells**.

### Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangement

The first part of this chapter focuses on the gene rearrangements that generate the **primary repertoire of immunoglobulins**. This includes a description of the **molecular mechanisms** that allow **B cells** to switch from producing **transmembrane immunoglobulins** to becoming **plasma cells**, which secrete **antibodies**. The **secreted form** of immunoglobulins is known as **antibodies**.

### T-Cell Receptor Gene Rearrangement

The second part of the chapter explores the gene rearrangements that generate the repertoire of **T-cell receptors**. Unlike immunoglobulins, **TCRs** only exist as **transmembrane receptors** and are never secreted.

### Evolutionary Variations in Gene Rearrangement

The final part of the chapter examines **alternative evolutionary forms** of gene rearrangement that give rise to different forms of **adaptive immunity** in other species, highlighting the evolutionary diversity in the mechanisms for generating immune receptor diversity.

### Primary Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangements and Expression 

Antibodies can target virtually any substance, and each antibody response involves many molecules with slightly different specificities and affinities. The total number of antibody specificities available, called the **immunoglobulin repertoire**, is estimated to be at least \(10^{11}\), though the actual number at any time is limited by the number of **B cells** in an individual and their previous encounters with antigens. Before the study of **immunoglobulin genes**, two hypotheses explained this diversity: 
1. **Germline Theory**: Proposed that the antibody repertoire is inherited, with a separate gene for each immunoglobulin. 
2. **Somatic Diversification Theory**: Suggested that a limited number of inherited **V-region sequences** are altered during B cell development to produce diversity. Both theories were partially correct. It was discovered that variable regions are created by **rearranging gene segments** during **somatic recombination**, a process further enhanced by **somatic hypermutation** in mature B cells.
## 5-1 Complete immunoglobulin genes are generated by the somatic recombination of separate gene segments
- **V(D)J Recombination**: The variable regions of immunoglobulins (antigen-binding sites) are encoded by V (variable), D (diversity), and J (joining) gene segments, which are rearranged to generate diversity.
- **Light Chain**: Rearrangement involves V and J segments, forming a complete variable region.
- **Heavy Chain**: Involves V, D, and J segments, creating more diversity. The VH (variable region of the heavy chain) is encoded by three gene segments.
## 5-2 Multiple contiguous V gene segments are present at each immunoglobulin locus
- **Gene Clusters**: Immunoglobulin genes are organized into three loci: one for the heavy chain and two for the light chains (κ and λ).
- **Human Loci**: The heavy chain is on chromosome 14, κ on chromosome 2, and λ on chromosome 22.
- **Multiple V, D, J Segments**: Different copies of V, D, and J gene segments exist in each locus, contributing to diversity. Pseudogenes are nonfunctional versions of gene segments that can rearrange but do not form functional antibodies.
## 5-3 Rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments is guided by flanking DNA sequences
- **Recombination Signal Sequences (RSSs)**: Flanking DNA sequences (RSS) guide recombination. RSS consists of a heptamer, spacer (12 or 23 bp), and nonamer.
- **12/23 Rule**: Ensures recombination occurs between segments flanked by 12-bp and 23-bp spacers, preventing V-to-V or J-to-J joining.
- **Mechanisms of DNA Recombination**: Looping out of DNA occurs for gene segments in the same transcriptional orientation, while inversion happens for segments with opposite orientations.
## 5-4 The reaction that recombines V, D, and J gene segments involves both lymphocyte-specific and ubiquitous DNA-modifying enzymes
- **RAG-1 and RAG-2**: Key lymphocyte-specific enzymes required for V(D)J recombination. They recognize RSS and cleave DNA at the coding segment's ends.
- **Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**: Ubiquitous DNA repair pathway involved in rejoining cleaved DNA ends. Ku, Artemis, and DNA ligase IV are critical components.
- **Junctional Diversity**: Introduced during recombination by the addition and removal of nucleotides by TdT and Artemis.
## 5-5 The diversity of the immunoglobulin repertoire is generated by four main processes
- **Combinatorial Diversity**: Arises from different combinations of V, D, and J segments.
- **Junctional Diversity**: Additional diversity introduced by adding/removing nucleotides at junctions.
- **Heavy and Light Chain Pairing**: Further diversity comes from the combination of different heavy and light chains.
- **Somatic Hypermutation**: Occurs after B-cell activation and introduces point mutations into V-region genes.
## 5-6 The multiple inherited gene segments are used in different combinations
- **Combinatorial Diversity**: The different combinations of V, D, and J gene segments result in around 1.5 million possible antibody specificities from just the inherited gene segments.
## 5-7 Variable addition and subtraction of nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments contributes to the diversity of the third hypervariable region
- **P-Nucleotides**: Short palindromic sequences added during hairpin opening by Artemis.
- **N-Nucleotides**: Non-templated nucleotides added by TdT during heavy chain rearrangement, further increasing diversity.
- **Junctional Diversity**: The randomness in the number of nucleotides added or removed creates unique sequences for the third hypervariable region (CDR3).
## 5-8 IgM and IgD are derived from the same pre-mRNA transcript and are both expressed on the surface of mature B cells
- **IgM and IgD Co-expression**: Mature B cells co-express membrane-bound IgM and IgD. This is regulated by RNA splicing of the same pre-mRNA transcript.
- **ZFP318**: A protein regulating the alternative splicing process, promoting IgD expression in mature B cells.
## 5-9 Transmembrane and secreted forms of immunoglobulin are generated from different heavy-chain mRNA transcripts
- **Alternative RNA Processing**: Transmembrane and secreted forms of immunoglobulins are produced by alternative splicing of heavy-chain mRNA.
- **Secretory vs. Membrane-bound**: Secreted antibodies lack a transmembrane domain, while membrane-bound antibodies retain a hydrophobic tail.
## Summary 
- **Diversity Mechanisms**: The diversity of immunoglobulins is generated by V(D)J recombination, the random addition of P- and N-nucleotides, pairing of different heavy and light chains, and somatic hypermutation.
- **Initial B-cell Receptors**: B cells initially express both IgM and IgD on their surfaces. Their coexpression is controlled by RNA splicing.
- **Regulation of Antibody Forms**: After activation, B cells produce secreted forms of antibodies, with different mechanisms regulating the transition from membrane-bound to secreted forms.

# T-Cell Receptor Gene Rearrangement Notes

## Introduction
- **Diversity Mechanism**: T-cell receptor diversity is generated by a similar mechanism to B-cell receptors, involving somatic recombination.
- **Structural Similarity**: T-cell receptors (TCR) are structurally related to immunoglobulins and utilize variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments to form complete receptors.
## 5-10 The T-cell receptor gene segments are arranged in a pattern similar to that of immunoglobulin gene segments and are rearranged by the same enzymes
- **Gene Structure**: TCRα and TCRβ loci are arranged similarly to immunoglobulin genes. TCRα resembles light chains (V, J segments), while TCRβ resembles heavy chains (V, D, J segments).
- **Mechanism**: T-cell receptor gene rearrangement occurs in the thymus, using the same enzymes that rearrange immunoglobulin genes, such as RAG-1 and RAG-2.
- **TREC Circles**: DNA circles formed during T-cell gene rearrangement (T-cell receptor excision circles) are markers for recent thymic emigrants.
- **P- and N-Nucleotides**: Like immunoglobulins, TCR rearrangement includes P- and N-nucleotide addition for increased diversity, particularly in the TCRβ chain.
## 5-11 T-cell receptors concentrate diversity in the third hypervariable region
- **CDR3 Importance**: The most variability in T-cell receptors is concentrated in the CDR3 region, which contacts the peptide bound to the MHC molecule.
- **Comparison to Antibodies**: In TCRs, the CDR3 region interacts with the antigenic peptide, while CDR1 and CDR2 contact the MHC component of the peptide:MHC complex.
- **Focused Diversity**: TCR diversity is more focused on peptide recognition, unlike the broader binding variety of antibodies to different antigen types.
## 5-12 γδ T-cell receptors are also generated by gene rearrangement
- **γδ T-Cells**: A minority of T-cells express γδ TCRs. These receptors are generated through gene rearrangement like αβ TCRs, but with different loci.
- **TCRδ Locus**: The TCRδ locus is located within the TCRα locus, and rearrangement at the TCRα locus deletes the TCRδ locus, determining lineage development.
- **Increased Junctional Variability**: TCRδ chains exhibit increased variability at the junctions, especially due to the use of two D segments in some rearrangements.
## Summary
- **TCR Similarity to Immunoglobulins**: TCRs are structurally similar to immunoglobulins, with V, D, and J gene segments being rearranged by the same mechanism. However, TCRs do not undergo somatic hypermutation.
- **Diversity Focus**: TCR diversity is focused in the CDR3 region, which interacts directly with antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules.
- **γδ T-Cells**: TCRs on γδ T-cells also focus diversity in the junctional region, allowing these receptors to recognize a distinct set of ligands, including nonclassical MHC molecules.

# Evolution of the Adaptive Immune Response Notes

## Introduction
- **Adaptive Immunity in Jawed Vertebrates**: The RAG-1:RAG-2 recombinase-based adaptive immune system is unique to jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), which emerged about 500 million years ago.
- **Immunity in Invertebrates**: Although invertebrates do not have adaptive immunity, they have developed mechanisms to diversify pathogen-detecting molecules.
- **Agnathans and Adaptive Immunity**: Jawless vertebrates, like lampreys and hagfish, have a unique adaptive immune system based on leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, which differs from the immunoglobulin-based system in jawed vertebrates.
## 5-13 Some invertebrates generate extensive diversity in a repertoire of immunoglobulin-like genes
- **Invertebrate Immunity**: Invertebrates like Drosophila and snails use different strategies to diversify immunoglobulin-like proteins, enhancing pathogen recognition.
- **Dscam in Drosophila**: The Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene produces thousands of isoforms through alternative splicing, potentially aiding in pathogen recognition.
- **FREPs in Snails**: Freshwater snails produce fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) that may diversify through somatic mutations, resembling somatic hypermutation in vertebrates.
## 5-14 Agnathans possess an adaptive immune system that uses somatic gene rearrangement to diversify receptors built from LRR domains
- **VLRs in Lampreys**: Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) in jawless vertebrates undergo somatic gene rearrangement to create diverse pathogen-recognition molecules using LRR domains.
- **Somatic Recombination**: VLR genes are assembled through a recombination process involving DNA cassettes that add LRR domains to create unique receptors for each lymphocyte.
- **Antigen Recognition**: VLRB lymphocytes function similarly to B cells, while VLRA and VLRC lymphocytes resemble αβ and γδ T cells, respectively.
## 5-15 RAG-dependent adaptive immunity based on a diversified repertoire of immunoglobulin-like genes appeared abruptly in the cartilaginous fishes
- **Transposon Theory**: The RAG system likely evolved from a transposon that inserted into an ancestral gene encoding an immunoglobulin-like receptor. This event led to the origin of the V(D)J recombination mechanism.
- **RAG Genes in Evolution**: RAG1 and RAG2 genes, essential for recombination, are thought to have evolved from a mobile genetic element related to DNA transposons.
- **Evolution of Immune Receptors**: Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes evolved from this insertion, creating the modern vertebrate adaptive immune system.
## 5-16 Different species generate immunoglobulin diversity in different ways
- **Gene Conversion in Birds and Rabbits**: In species like birds and rabbits, immunoglobulin diversity is generated by gene conversion rather than V(D)J recombination.
- **Somatic Hypermutation in Livestock**: In sheep and cows, diversification occurs through somatic hypermutation in specialized lymphoid tissues.
- **Sharks and Primitive Fishes**: In cartilaginous fishes, immunoglobulin diversity arises from the rearrangement of pre-rearranged germline loci, combining light and heavy chains for receptor diversity.
## 5-17 Both αβ and γδ T-cell receptors are present in cartilaginous fishes
- **TCRs in Early Vertebrates**: T-cell receptors (TCRs) first appeared in cartilaginous fishes, with both αβ and γδ TCRs already diversified into two recognition systems.
- **Function of γδ T Cells**: γδ T cells recognize microbial lipids and stressed cells, hinting at a more innate-like role, which may reflect an early stage of adaptive immune system evolution.
## 5-18 MHC class I and class II molecules are also first found in the cartilaginous fishes
- **MHC Emergence**: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules, crucial for T-cell activation, first appear in cartilaginous fishes.
- **Polymorphism in Sharks**: Like in mammals, MHC molecules in sharks are polymorphic, ensuring diversity in peptide presentation to T cells.
- **Classical and Nonclassical MHC**: The division between classical MHC class I and nonclassical MHC class Ib genes already exists in sharks, marking an important evolutionary step.
## Summary
- **Evolution of Adaptive Immunity**: The RAG-based adaptive immune system in jawed vertebrates likely originated from the insertion of a transposon into an ancestral immunoglobulin-like gene.
- **Independent Evolution of Immunity**: Jawless vertebrates (agnathans) evolved a separate adaptive immune system based on LRR proteins, demonstrating that adaptive immunity can evolve in different ways.
- **Co-evolution of MHC and TCR**: MHC molecules and TCRs co-evolved, with their first appearance in cartilaginous fishes, suggesting an integrated development of adaptive immune functions.

# Chapter 5 Summary

The antigen receptors of lymphocytes exhibit remarkable diversity, achieved through a shared mechanism in developing B cells and T cells. Both types of cells assemble functional genes for their immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor chains via **somatic recombination** of separate gene segments that together encode the variable (V) region. The main building blocks for this process are arrays of **V**, **D**, and **J** gene segments present in all antigen-receptor gene loci.

The **RAG-1** and **RAG-2** proteins play a crucial role in site-specific cleavage of DNA at **recombination signal sequences (RSSs)** flanking these segments, initiating the process by forming double-strand breaks. These proteins work alongside ubiquitous DNA-modifying enzymes from the double-strand break repair pathway and the lymphoid-specific enzyme **TdT** to assemble the genes. A major source of diversity stems from the random selection of one segment from each set and from the **imprecise joining** mechanisms at the coding junctions, which increase variability, especially within the **CDR3 loops** at the antigen-binding sites.

Further diversity arises from the independent pairing of two immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor chains to form a complete antigen receptor. A key distinction between **immunoglobulins** and **T-cell receptors** lies in their function: immunoglobulins can be expressed in both membrane-bound (B-cell receptor) and secreted (antibody) forms, facilitated by **alternative splicing** of heavy-chain mRNA. T-cell receptors, however, remain membrane-bound. Immunoglobulins also have heavier chains with three or four constant-region domains, while T-cell receptor chains have only one.

Other species, like the agnathans (jawless vertebrates), have developed their own systems for diversifying immune receptors, such as the **variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs)**. These receptors also undergo somatic rearrangement, similar to the process in jawed vertebrates, though VLRs are based on leucine-rich repeat domains rather than immunoglobulin domains.

The evolution of adaptive immunity in **jawed vertebrates** (gnathostomes) likely arose through the integration of a **DNA transposon** containing prototype RAG1 and RAG2 genes into an ancestral V-type immunoglobulin-like gene, leading to the creation of the diverse **T-cell and B-cell receptor genes** seen today.
