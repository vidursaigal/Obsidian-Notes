5-3 Rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments is guided by flanking DNA sequences.

5-4 The reaction that recombines V, D, and J gene segments involves both lymphocyte-specific and ubiquitous DNA-modifying enzymes.

5-5 The diversity of the immunoglobulin repertoire is generated by four main processes.

5-6 The multiple inherited gene segments are used in different combinations.

5-7 Variable addition and subtraction of nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments contributes to the diversity of the third hypervariable region.

5-8 IgM and IgD are derived from the same pre-mRNA transcript and are both expressed on the surface of mature B cells.

5-9 Transmembrane and secreted forms of immunoglobulin are generated from different heavy-chain mRNA transcripts.

5-10 The T-cell receptor gene segments are arranged in a pattern similar to that of immunoglobulin gene segments and are rearranged by the same enzymes.

5-11 T-cell receptors concentrate diversity in the third hypervariable region.

5-12 γδ T-cell receptors are also generated by gene rearrangement.

5-13 Some invertebrates generate extensive diversity in a repertoire of immunoglobulin-like genes.

5-14 Agnathans possess an adaptive immune system that uses somatic gene rearrangement to diversify receptors built from LRR domains.

5-15 RAG-dependent adaptive immunity based on a diversified repertoire of immunoglobulin-like genes appeared abruptly in the cartilaginous fishes.

5-16 Different species generate immunoglobulin diversity in different ways.

5-17 Both αβ and γδ T-cell receptors are present in cartilaginous fishes.

5-18 MHC class I and class II molecules are also first found in the cartilaginous fishes.
