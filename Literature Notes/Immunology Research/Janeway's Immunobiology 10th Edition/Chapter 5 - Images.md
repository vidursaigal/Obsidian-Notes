5-1 Complete immunoglobulin genes are generated by the somatic recombination of separate gene segments.

5-2 Multiple contiguous V gene segments are present at each immunoglobulin locus.

5-3 Rearrangement of V, D, and J gene segments is guided by flanking DNA sequences.

5-4 The reaction that recombines V, D, and J gene segments involves both lymphocyte-specific and ubiquitous DNA-modifying enzymes.

5-5 The diversity of the immunoglobulin repertoire is generated by four main processes.

5-6 The multiple inherited gene segments are used in different combinations.

5-7 Variable addition and subtraction of nucleotides at the junctions between gene segments contributes to the diversity of the third hypervariable region.

5-8 IgM and IgD are derived from the same pre-mRNA transcript and are both expressed on the surface of mature B cells.

5-9 Transmembrane and secreted forms of immunoglobulin are generated from different heavy-chain mRNA transcripts.
