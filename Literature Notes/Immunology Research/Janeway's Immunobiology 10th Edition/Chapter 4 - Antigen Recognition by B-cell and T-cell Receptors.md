## Introduction to Adaptive Immune Responses

Innate immune responses are the body's initial defense against infections, utilizing molecular patterns and nonspecific defenses like **interferons**. However, to combat the diverse range of pathogens an individual may encounter, the **adaptive immune system** has evolved to recognize a variety of antigens. An **antigen** is any molecule recognized by the specialized receptors of **lymphocytes**. In **B cells**, these recognition proteins are **immunoglobulins (Igs)**, which exist in a membrane-bound form as the **B-cell receptor (BCR)** and a secreted form known as **antibodies**. Antibodies are produced by **plasma cells** and **plasmablasts** and serve as the primary effector mechanism of B cells in adaptive immunity.

### Antibodies: Structure and Function

Antibodies have two main functions:
1. **Specific binding** to pathogens or their products that initiate the immune response.
2. **Recruitment of other immune cells** to destroy pathogens.

Antibodies can neutralize pathogens, promote phagocytosis, and activate the complement system. They have a **variable region (V region)** for antigen binding, which allows for extensive diversity in antibody recognition. The **constant region (C region)**, which does not vary like the V region, is responsible for engaging immune effector functions and exists in five main forms called **isotypes**.

The **B-cell receptor (BCR)** only functions to bind antigens and signal the B cell for activation, leading to **clonal expansion** and **antibody production**. The signaling components of the BCR will be covered in later chapters.

### T-Cell Receptors (TCRs)

Unlike B-cell receptors, **T-cell receptors (TCRs)** are membrane-bound proteins that only serve to signal T cells for activation. TCRs recognize **peptide fragments** presented by **MHC molecules** on the surface of host cells. These receptors share structural similarities with immunoglobulins, including having **V** and **C regions**, but differ in recognizing peptides bound to **MHC molecules**.

### MHC Molecules and T-Cell Activation

**MHC molecules** are encoded by a highly polymorphic cluster of genes known as the **major histocompatibility complex (MHC)**. These molecules have a cleft in which peptides bind and present antigens to **T-cell receptors (TCRs)**. Each individual typically expresses different alleles of MHC molecules, increasing the diversity of peptides that can be presented to T cells. The combination of **MHC molecules** and **peptide antigens** introduces the concept of **MHC restriction**, where a specific TCR only recognizes a particular peptide bound to a particular MHC molecule.

### Chapter Focus

This chapter explores the **structure** and **antigen-binding properties** of **immunoglobulins** and **T-cell receptors**. Despite differences in how B cells and T cells recognize antigens, the structural basis for this recognition is remarkably similar. The chapter lays the foundation for further discussions on **MHC polymorphism**, **T-cell development**, and **adaptive immune responses** in later chapters.

# Structure of Antibodies

Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are crucial in the immune response for their role in binding to antigens and recruiting effector molecules. They are the secreted forms of B-cell receptors and are highly soluble, making them easy to study. The structural characteristics of antibodies allow them to bind a wide variety of antigens while also facilitating immune responses.
## 4-1 IgG Antibodies Consist of Four Polypeptide Chains

**Key Points:**
- IgG molecules are composed of two **heavy (H) chains** and two **light (L) chains**.
- Each IgG molecule has two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, linked by disulfide bonds.
- The two antigen-binding sites provide the antibody with **avidity** (overall binding strength), while **affinity** refers to the strength of a single binding site.
- **Light chains** can be either kappa (κ) or lambda (λ), and the ratio of these chains varies by species (e.g., 2:1 in humans, 20:1 in mice).

**Notes:**
- Antibodies can bind two identical antigens simultaneously, increasing the strength of their interaction.
- Variations in the light-chain ratio can signal the proliferation of a B-cell clone, which is useful for detecting certain B-cell tumors.
## 4-2 Immunoglobulin Heavy and Light Chains Are Composed of Constant and Variable Regions

**Key Points:**
- Both heavy and light chains consist of **constant (C) regions** and **variable (V) regions**.
- The **V regions** determine the antigen-binding specificity, while the **C regions** provide structural support and facilitate interaction with effector molecules.
- The **amino-terminal variable domains (VH and VL)** make up the antigen-binding site, while the constant domains (CH and CL) form the trunk of the Y-shaped antibody.

**Notes:**
- The V regions vary greatly between antibodies, contributing to their ability to bind a wide range of antigens.
- The constant regions are more conserved across antibodies of the same class.
## 4-3 The Domains of an Immunoglobulin Molecule Have Similar Structures

**Key Points:**
- Both V and C domains share a structural organization known as the **immunoglobulin fold**, consisting of two **β-sheets** folded into a **β-sandwich**.
- **Disulfide bonds** stabilize the fold.
- V domains contain extra **β-strands (C′ and C″)**, which contribute to the antigen-binding site.

**Notes:**
- The **V domains** are responsible for antigen recognition, while the **C domains** interact with the immune system's effector functions.
- This immunoglobulin fold is a characteristic of many immune system proteins.
## 4-4 The Antibody Molecule Can Be Cleaved Into Functionally Distinct Fragments

**Key Points:**
- Proteolytic enzymes like **papain** can cleave the antibody into distinct fragments: **Fab (antigen-binding)** and **Fc (crystallizable)**.
- The **Fab fragment** retains antigen-binding activity, while the **Fc fragment** interacts with effector molecules (e.g., complement or Fc receptors).
- **Pepsin** digestion produces an **F(ab′)2 fragment**, which retains both antigen-binding sites linked together but lacks the Fc region.

**Notes:**
- Fab fragments are useful for studying antigen-binding independently of effector functions, while Fc fragments are involved in immune signaling.
## 4-5 The Hinge Region of the Immunoglobulin Molecule Allows Flexibility in Binding to Multiple Antigens

**Key Points:**
- The **hinge region** between the Fc and Fab portions allows flexibility, enabling the antibody to bind antigens spaced at different distances.
- Flexibility is also found at the junction between the **V and C domains**.

**Notes:**
- This flexibility enables antibodies to cross-link repeating antigens (e.g., bacterial cell-wall polysaccharides), increasing immune effectiveness.
# Summary of Antibody Structure

The typical **IgG antibody** molecule consists of four polypeptide chains (two heavy and two light), arranged in a flexible **Y-shape**. The **V regions** of the heavy and light chains pair to form two identical **antigen-binding sites** at the tips of the Y arms. The **constant regions** (C) form the **Fc fragment**, which mediates interactions with effector molecules. Flexibility at the **hinge region** and **V-C junction** allows antibodies to bind multiple antigens at varying distances, enhancing immune responses. Antibodies can be cleaved into **Fab** and **Fc** fragments to study their antigen-binding and effector functions separately.

# Structural Variation in Immunoglobulin Constant Regions

Immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules are classified into five isotypes (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, IgE), which differ in their **constant regions** and determine their functional properties. These structural variations allow different antibody classes to perform specialized immune responses.
## 4-6 Different Classes of Immunoglobulins are Distinguished by the Structure of Their Heavy-Chain Constant Regions

**Key Points:**
- The five main antibody isotypes—**IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE**—are distinguished by the structure of their **heavy chains**.
- Heavy chains are denoted by the Greek letters **μ (IgM), δ (IgD), γ (IgG), α (IgA),** and **ϵ (IgE)**.
- Some isotypes, like **IgM** and **IgA**, form **multimers** (pentamers and dimers, respectively), enhancing their ability to bind repetitive antigen structures.

**Notes:**
- **IgG** is the most abundant antibody in serum and exists in four subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4).
- **IgM** and **IgA** can form multimers, helping to bind antigens with repetitive structures, such as bacterial surfaces.
## 4-7 The Constant Region Confers Functional Specialization on the Antibody

**Key Points:**
- The **Fc region** of the antibody determines its effector functions, including:
  - **Fc receptor binding** on cells like macrophages and mast cells.
  - **Complement activation** (through the classical pathway).
  - **Transport regulation** across tissues.
- Different isotypes specialize in activating various immune mechanisms, such as **IgG1** and **IgG3** promoting phagocytosis via **Fcγ receptors**, while **IgE** binds to **Fcϵ receptors** on mast cells, triggering inflammatory responses.

**Notes:**
- **IgA** and **IgG** are transported across body compartments through specific receptors like **poly-Ig receptor (pIgR)** for IgA and **FcRn** for IgG.
## 4-8 IgM and IgA Can Form Polymers by Interacting with the J Chain

**Key Points:**
- **IgM** is typically secreted as a **pentamer**, and **IgA** as a **dimer**, both associated with a **J chain** that facilitates polymerization.
- The **J chain** links heavy chains in secreted forms of IgM and IgA, enhancing their avidity (overall binding strength) for antigens, especially those with repetitive structures, like bacterial polysaccharides.
- **IgM** is particularly effective due to its **10 antigen-binding sites**, compensating for its lower affinity by providing high avidity.

**Notes:**
- **IgM** is produced early in immune responses and is important for neutralizing pathogens before affinity maturation occurs.
- **IgA** is crucial for mucosal immunity, being secreted into areas like the gut, respiratory tract, and breast milk.
# Summary

Immunoglobulin isotypes differ in their **constant regions**, defining their functional roles within the immune system. These differences enable antibodies to interact with various immune cells and molecules, such as **Fc receptors** on effector cells, **complement proteins**, and **transport receptors** like **pIgR** and **FcRn**. Isotypes like **IgM** and **IgA** can form **multimers**, which significantly increase their **avidity** for antigens with repetitive structures. This structural variability equips antibodies to carry out specialized immune responses, from complement activation to targeted pathogen neutralization at mucosal surfaces.

# The Interaction of the Antibody Molecule with Specific Antigen

This section explores how antigen-binding sites in immunoglobulins interact with specific antigens and how sequence variation in V domains determines antigen specificity.
## 4-9 Localized Regions of Hypervariable Sequence Form the Antigen-Binding Site

**Key Points:**
- The **V regions** of antibodies contain **hypervariable regions** (HV1, HV2, HV3) located within specific segments of both heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains.
- These hypervariable regions are interspersed with **framework regions (FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4)**, which provide structural stability.
- The hypervariable loops from the VH and VL domains together create the **antigen-binding site**.
- These loops are also referred to as **complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)** because they form the surface that is complementary to the antigen.

**Notes:**
- The **CDR3** region tends to have the greatest variability and is critical in determining antigen specificity.
- **Combinatorial diversity** results from different combinations of VH and VL regions, providing an extensive array of antigen recognition capabilities.
## 4-10 Antibodies Bind Antigens via Contacts in CDRs that are Complementary to the Size and Shape of the Antigen

**Key Points:**
- Antigen binding typically occurs at the **juxtaposition of the CDRs** from the heavy and light chains.
- Antibodies can bind to antigens through various modes: **pockets, grooves, or extended surfaces**.
- In some cases, a long **CDR3 loop** from the heavy chain can protrude into a recess on the antigen surface, creating a tight fit.
- The **shape** of the antigen-binding site—whether concave, flat, or convex—depends on the type of antigen being bound.

**Notes:**
- Antigens can range in size from small haptens to large protein complexes, with the binding interface shaped by the CDRs.
- The specificity of the antibody depends on the **complementary surface** created by the antibody's CDRs.

## 4-11 Antibodies Bind to Conformational Shapes on the Surfaces of Antigens Using a Variety of Noncovalent Forces

**Key Points:**
- Antibodies typically recognize **epitopes** on the surface of antigens. These can be **conformational (discontinuous)** epitopes formed by protein folding or **linear (continuous)** epitopes composed of a single segment of the polypeptide chain.
- Antigen-antibody binding is mediated by **noncovalent forces**, including:
  - **Electrostatic interactions**
  - **Hydrogen bonds**
  - **Van der Waals forces**
  - **Hydrophobic interactions**
  - **Cation-pi interactions**

**Notes:**
- Antigen-binding can be disrupted by **high salt concentrations, pH extremes**, or **detergents**, as these interfere with the noncovalent forces.
- **Hydrophobic interactions** often contribute significantly to binding strength by excluding water from the antigen-antibody interface.
## 4-12 Antibody Interaction with Intact Antigens is Influenced by Steric Constraints

**Key Points:**
- **Steric hindrance** can affect how antibodies interact with large antigens like viruses, where the arrangement of proteins on the surface may prevent some antibody binding sites from accessing the antigen.
- For example, in **West Nile virus**, only a subset of the 180 potential binding sites for an antibody is accessible due to steric effects.

**Notes:**
- The spatial arrangement of antigens on pathogens can limit the ability of antibodies to neutralize targets effectively.
## 4-13 Some Species Generate Antibodies with Alternative Structures

**Key Points:**
- Some species, like **camelids** (e.g., camels, llamas, alpacas), produce **heavy-chain-only antibodies (hcIgGs)**, which lack light chains but still bind antigen.
- **Cartilaginous fish**, such as sharks, also produce heavy-chain-only antibodies called **IgNARs**, suggesting **convergent evolution** in the development of these alternative antibody forms.
- **Single-chain antibodies** derived from camelid VH domains are of great interest for therapeutic and research applications due to their simplified structure.

**Notes:**
- These **alternative antibodies** rely on the **CDR3 loop** for antigen binding and may have evolved to meet different immunological challenges in their respective species.
# Summary

Antibodies recognize and bind to antigens using their **complementarity-determining regions (CDRs)**, located in the variable (V) regions of the heavy and light chains. The specific binding site is formed by the combination of CDRs from both chains, with the **CDR3 region** playing a major role in antigen specificity. Antibodies interact with antigens using **noncovalent forces** such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic interactions. Steric hindrance can sometimes prevent full antibody binding to large, complex antigens. Some species, such as camelids and sharks, produce **heavy-chain-only antibodies**, which offer a simpler structure for antigen recognition. These alternative antibodies are becoming valuable tools in both research and therapeutic contexts.

# Summary

T cells recognize antigens via the **T-cell receptor (TCR)**, which interacts with **peptide:MHC complexes** presented on the surface of infected or antigen-presenting cells. **TCRs** are structurally similar to **immunoglobulins**, but while antibodies recognize intact antigens, TCRs recognize **processed peptide fragments** bound to MHC molecules. Two classes of **MHC molecules**—**MHC class I** and **MHC class II**—present peptides from different sources, with **CD8+ T cells** recognizing class I molecules and **CD4+ T cells** recognizing class II molecules. The co-receptors **CD4** and **CD8** enhance T-cell activation by binding to **non-polymorphic regions** of the MHC molecule. A minority of T cells express **TCRγδ**, recognizing **non-peptide antigens** in an **MHC-independent manner**.

### Chapter 4 Summary

B cells and T cells use different but structurally similar molecules to recognize antigens. **B cells** utilize **immunoglobulins**, which can be found both as membrane-bound receptors (the **B-cell receptor**) and as **secreted antibodies**. These antibodies bind antigens and elicit **humoral immune responses**. In contrast, **T cells** have **T-cell receptors (TCRs)**, which exist only as cell-surface receptors and engage solely in **cellular immune functions**.

Immunoglobulins and TCRs exhibit high variability in their **variable (V) regions**, which determine antigen specificity. While **immunoglobulins** can bind a diverse array of antigens, **TCRs** predominantly recognize **peptide fragments** of foreign proteins presented by **MHC molecules** on the surface of cells.

Antibody-antigen binding is highly specific and involves **shape** and **physicochemical properties** at the **antigen-binding site**. The opposite end of the antibody—the **constant (Fc) region**—determines the effector functions the antibody can trigger. There are five main classes of antibodies, each with different constant regions that interact with immune system components to elicit various immune responses, as explored in Chapter 10.

**T-cell receptors** differ from immunoglobulins in that they are not secreted. This reflects the distinct roles of **B cells** and **T cells**. While B cells target extracellular pathogens and antigens, **T cells** are specialized for **intracellular surveillance**, engaging only when antigen is presented on the surface of a body cell via **MHC molecules**. 

Moreover, T-cell receptors recognize a **composite ligand** made of a foreign peptide and a self **MHC molecule**, ensuring T cells interact only with infected or antigen-presenting cells. This specificity to MHC and peptide combinations is crucial for immune surveillance. The diversity in MHC molecules, encoded by highly polymorphic genes, ensures that T cells can recognize a broad range of peptide antigens derived from various pathogens.
