Q1: Please name two lymphoid organs or tissues and explain their function. 

Two important lymphoid organs are:
1. **Thymus**: The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ located in the upper chest. It plays a crucial role in the development and maturation of T-cells (T lymphocytes), which are essential for the adaptive immune system. Immature T-cells, or thymocytes, migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they undergo selection processes to ensure they can properly recognize antigens and do not attack the body's own cells (self-tolerance).
2. **Spleen**: The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ located in the upper left part of the abdomen. It functions as a blood filter, removing old or damaged red blood cells and pathogens. The spleen also plays a critical role in mounting an immune response by storing white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages, and allowing them to interact with antigens from the bloodstream, facilitating the production of antibodies and activation of immune cells.

Q2: Please name the major steps of how macrophages control pathogens and alert other immune cells. Briefly describe these steps. 

1. **Recognition and Phagocytosis**: Macrophages recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Once recognized, the macrophage engulfs the pathogen into a vesicle called a phagosome.
2. **Pathogen Destruction**: The phagosome fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome, where enzymes and reactive oxygen species break down and kill the pathogen.
3. **Antigen Presentation**: After degrading the pathogen, macrophages process its proteins into small peptide fragments. These fragments are loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules and displayed on the macrophage’s surface to signal other immune cells.
4. **Cytokine Release**: Macrophages release signaling molecules called cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) that help recruit and activate other immune cells, such as neutrophils and T-cells, to the site of infection.
5. **Activation of Adaptive Immune Response**: By presenting antigens on MHC molecules, macrophages activate T-cells, particularly helper T-cells, which in turn coordinate a more targeted adaptive immune response, including the activation of B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells.\

Q3: Please illustrate an IgE structure and make sure all the disulfide bonds are included. Please mark the Fab fragment and the Fc fragment. 


Q4: Please explain the following figure in the context of a new experimental vaccine that was introduced to a mouse.
![[Pasted image 20241008214317.png]]\
![[Pasted image 20241008231958.png]]
- **Primary Response (First Exposure to Antigen A)**:
    
    - After the initial introduction of the vaccine containing **Antigen A**, there is a **lag phase** where antibody production is minimal, indicating that the immune system is beginning to recognize and process the antigen.
    - As the immune response progresses, antibody levels against Antigen A begin to rise, peaking around 12-16 days. This reflects the activation of B-cells, their differentiation into plasma cells, and the production of antibodies specifically targeting Antigen A. However, this response is relatively slow and low in magnitude compared to future exposures.
    
- **Secondary Response (Second Exposure to Antigen A and Introduction of Antigen B)**:
    
    - Around day 60, the mouse is exposed to **both Antigen A and Antigen B** (indicating a booster dose or a new part of the vaccine that introduces another antigen).
    - For **Antigen A**, the response is much faster and stronger. This is due to **immunological memory**: memory B-cells that were formed during the primary response quickly recognize Antigen A and produce a significantly higher level of antibodies within a shorter time frame. This is the hallmark of the **secondary immune response**, characterized by both speed and magnitude.
    - For **Antigen B**, the response resembles the primary response seen earlier for Antigen A. There is a delay in antibody production as the immune system processes this newly introduced antigen.

Q5: Please use the information in the table to calculate potential V(D)J combinatorial diversity of the human T-cell receptor repertoire. 

|                                  | β-chain | α-chain |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| # of variable gene segments (V)  | 30      | 100     |
| # of diversity gene segments (D) | 2       | 0       |
| # of joining gene segments (J)   | 12      | 50      |
(Multiply them all together?)

Q6: Please list three similarities and three differences between an antibody and a TCR. You can consider areas such as their diversity generation, structure, and functions.

### Similarities between Antibodies and T-cell Receptors (TCRs):

1. **Diversity Generation**: Both antibodies and TCRs undergo **V(D)J recombination**, which allows for the generation of a highly diverse repertoire of receptors capable of recognizing a vast array of antigens. This process includes the random joining of **variable (V)**, **diversity (D)** (for antibodies and TCR β-chains), and **joining (J)** gene segments.
    
2. **Structure**: Both antibodies and TCRs are **heterodimeric proteins**. Antibodies consist of two heavy chains and two light chains, while TCRs are composed of an **α-chain** and a **β-chain**. Both have variable regions at their tips that recognize antigens and constant regions that help with structural integrity and signaling.
    
3. **Antigen Recognition**: Both molecules recognize specific antigens via their **variable regions**. The variable region in antibodies binds directly to the antigen, while the TCR binds to a processed antigen presented on an **MHC molecule** (Major Histocompatibility Complex) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.

### Differences between Antibodies and T-cell Receptors:

1. **Antigen Binding**:
    
    - **Antibodies** can bind directly to **free-floating antigens** (proteins, polysaccharides, lipids) in their native form.
    - **TCRs** can only recognize antigens that are processed and presented on **MHC molecules** on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.
2. **Function**:
    
    - **Antibodies** are primarily secreted by **B-cells** and function to **neutralize pathogens** by binding to them and facilitating their destruction via mechanisms like opsonization, complement activation, and phagocytosis.
    - **TCRs** remain membrane-bound on **T-cells** and function to **initiate cellular immune responses** by activating T-cells, which in turn direct the immune response, such as killing infected cells (cytotoxic T-cells) or helping other immune cells (helper T-cells).
3. **Structure of Antigen-Binding Site**:
    
    - **Antibodies** have **two identical antigen-binding sites** (bivalent), allowing them to cross-link antigens and form immune complexes.
    - **TCRs** have **only one antigen-binding site**, making them monovalent, and they require interaction with both the antigen and the MHC molecule for proper binding and activation.

Q7: Please explain how GCPR transduces the outside signal of ligand binding to intracellular signaling. 

### 1. **Ligand Binding**:

- A **ligand** (e.g., a hormone, neurotransmitter, or sensory signal like light or odor) binds to the extracellular domain of the GPCR.
- GPCRs have seven transmembrane domains, and the binding of the ligand causes a conformational change in the receptor, particularly in the intracellular portions.

### 2. **Conformational Change**:

- Upon ligand binding, the GPCR undergoes a **conformational change** that alters its intracellular structure. This change allows the receptor to interact with a **heterotrimeric G protein** (composed of α, β, and γ subunits), which is associated with the inner membrane surface.

### 3. **G Protein Activation**:

- In its inactive state, the G protein is bound to **GDP** (guanosine diphosphate) on the α subunit. The conformational change in the GPCR facilitates the exchange of **GDP for GTP** (guanosine triphosphate) on the α subunit, thus activating the G protein.
- This causes the G protein to dissociate into two parts: the **α-GTP** subunit and the **βγ dimer**. Both of these components can now interact with various intracellular effector proteins.

### 4. **Signal Propagation**:

- The activated **α-GTP** subunit and the **βγ dimer** interact with downstream effector proteins. These effectors could be:
    - **Adenylyl cyclase**, which produces **cyclic AMP (cAMP)** from ATP, leading to the activation of **protein kinase A (PKA)** and other downstream pathways.
    - **Phospholipase C (PLC)**, which cleaves **PIP2** into **IP3** and **DAG**. **IP3** triggers calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, while **DAG** activates **protein kinase C (PKC)**.
    - **Ion channels**, modulating the flow of ions such as calcium, potassium, or sodium into the cell.
- These effectors propagate the signal further inside the cell, leading to changes in cell activity such as gene expression, metabolism, or cell movement.

### 5. **Signal Termination**:

- The signal is terminated when the **α subunit** hydrolyzes **GTP back to GDP**, a process that can be accelerated by proteins called **GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)**.
- This hydrolysis inactivates the G protein, and the α subunit re-associates with the βγ dimer, returning the G protein to its inactive state.
- GPCRs may also undergo desensitization through phosphorylation by **GPCR kinases (GRKs)** and subsequent binding of **arrestins**, which block further G protein activation.

### Summary:

- In summary, GPCRs convert the extracellular signal of ligand binding into an intracellular response by activating G proteins. The G proteins, in turn, activate effector proteins like adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C, leading to the generation of second messengers (e.g., cAMP, IP3, DAG). These second messengers initiate a cascade of intracellular signals, ultimately altering cellular responses, including gene expression, enzyme activity, or ion channel function.

Monoclonal vs polyclonal antibodies (differences, when you would use either)
Mechanism by which pathogen goes from blood to tissue
We will have to draw a diagram
VDJ recombination  -> Math,
MHC Class 1 and Class 2 -> Class 1 -> every cell in the body (exogenous), Class 2 -> antigen presenting cell (T Cell)
GPCRs, Lymph Nodes (systems),
Macrophages -> M1 vs M2 macrophages -> general pathway (phagocytes, not granulocytes even though they have granules) 

VDJ system -
Light chain has variable components -> in between variable and constant there is a J, can be slices so that V is next to a J which is next to a constant -> 23/12 rule 
	Splicing occurs as a lymphocyte matures, only has one splice in their genome.

three regions of hyper variability -> each contribute a piece to the variable region -> after folding, only a specific peptide binds to this. 

Human B cell repertoire (VDJ):


Variable:
Kappa - 15

Heavy - 30

D Heavy - 20

J: 
Kappa - 5 
Lambda - 5
