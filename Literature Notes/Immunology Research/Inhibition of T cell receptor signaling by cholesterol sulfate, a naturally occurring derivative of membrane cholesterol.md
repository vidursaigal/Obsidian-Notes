# **Key Points of the Article**
## **Inhibition of T Cell Receptor Signaling by Cholesterol Sulfate**
- **T Cell Activation & TCR Complex**: T cells mediate immune responses through the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex, which initiates intracellular signaling upon antigen binding.
- **Cholesterol Sulfate (CS) as an Inhibitor**: CS, a naturally occurring derivative of cholesterol, inhibits CD3 ITAM phosphorylation, an early step in TCR signaling.
- **Mechanism of Inhibition**:
  - CS displaces cholesterol from the TCRβ subunit, disrupting TCR nanoclustering.
  - CS-treated T cells exhibit reduced phosphorylation of key signaling proteins (CD3ζ and S6).
  - IL-2 secretion, a marker of T cell activation, is reduced in CS-treated cells.
- **Impact on Thymocyte Development**:
  - CS levels are **low in double-positive (DP) thymocytes** but increase in single-positive (SP) thymocytes.
  - Intrathymic CS injection induces apoptosis in DP thymocytes, suggesting a role in **positive selection failure**.
  - **SULT2B1-deficient mice (lacking CS synthesis)** exhibit enhanced negative selection, leading to a lower frequency of self-reactive HY-specific T cells.
- **Biological Significance**:
  - CS regulates TCR sensitivity and **thymocyte selection**.
  - CS might serve as a therapeutic target to modulate **T cell activation in autoimmune diseases or immunotherapies**.

# **Figure Descriptions**
### **Figure 1**: CS inhibits TCR signaling
- Flow cytometry shows that CS treatment reduces **CD3ζ and S6 phosphorylation**.
- CS decreases IL-2 secretion in response to antigen presentation.

### **Figure 2**: CS disrupts TCR nanoclusters
- CS reduces the binding of **peptide–MHC tetramers** to TCRs.
- Blue native PAGE analysis reveals that **CS disrupts high-molecular-weight TCR nanoclusters**.

### **Figure 3**: CS associates with TCR and displaces cholesterol
- Mass spectrometry shows that CS preferentially binds **TCR over transferrin receptor (TfR)**.
- Cholesterol-bead pulldown assay confirms that **CS competes with cholesterol** for TCR binding.

### **Figure 4**: CS abundance is regulated during thymocyte development
- DP thymocytes have lower **Sult2b1 expression** and higher **Sts expression**.
- The CS-to-cholesterol ratio is significantly lower in DP compared to SP thymocytes.

### **Figure 5**: Increasing CS levels induces apoptosis in DP thymocytes
- Intrathymic injection of CS reduces DP thymocyte populations.
- Annexin V and TUNEL assays confirm increased apoptosis in **CS-treated DP thymocytes**.

### **Figure 6**: SULT2B1 deficiency enhances negative selection
- **Sult2b1−/− male mice** have a lower frequency of HY-specific CD8+ T cells, indicating **increased negative selection**.
- HY tetramer binding intensity is lower, suggesting **reduced TCR avidity**.

### **Figure 7**: Development of HY-specific T cells in Sult2b1−/− bone marrow
- Bone marrow chimera experiments show that **SULT2B1-deficient thymocytes** undergo **increased negative selection** in a cell-autonomous manner.
