US Drug Approval Pathways:
Before clinical trials the following must be submitted to FDA:
1.) Investigational New Drug (IND)
After clinical trials one of the following must be submitted:
1.) New Drug Application (NDA) - for small molecules
2.) Biologics Licsense Application (BLA) - for biologic therapies

Accelerated Pathways:
1.) Fast Track - expedite drugs that target serious conditions that have high unmet need; benefits include more frequent interactions with the FDA and the ability to submit regulatory filing on a rolling basis
2.) Breakthrough Therapy - expedite drugs that may offer substantial improvements over existing treatments; benefits also include increased FDA interactions and rolling submissions but also includes additional support to accelerate development
3.) Accelerated Approval - allows for drugs that treat serious conditions to be approved based on surrogate endpoints (eg. tumor shrinkage in cancer). This may allow for conditional approval after a phase 2, with phase 3 still required to confirm efficacy and safety
4.) Priority Review - Shortens the FDA's review period from 10 months to six months; used for drugs that have a significant therapeutic advantage over existing treatments

Also, not formally designated, but sponsors can utilize hybrid clinical trials (Phase 1/2 and Phase 2/3) to reduce time -- subject to FDA approval. 

Terminology:
SG&A - Selling, General, & Administrative - expenses related to marketing, distribution, and business operations

SAM - Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM) - the portion of the total market that a biotech can realistically target given its specific therapeutic profile, pricing etc.

Discovery and Preclinical Development: 
Duration: avg 5.5 years
~1 year to identify a drug target 
~1.5 years to find a lead candidate 
~2 years for optimization 
~1 year for animal testing
These initial studies form the basis of the IND application
