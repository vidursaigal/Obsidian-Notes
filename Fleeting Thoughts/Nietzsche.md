"The most intelligent men, like the strongest, find their happiness where others would find only disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult task as a privilege; it is to them a recreation to play with burdens that would crush all others."
- Quote from The Anti-Christ


*Übermensch* - The ideal superior man of the future who could rise above conventional Christian morality to create and impose his own values, originally described by Nietzsche in _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ (1883–85)
