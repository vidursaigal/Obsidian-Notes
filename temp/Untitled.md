Aggregation and nuclear clearance of the RNA‐binding protein TDP‑43 are hallmarks of ALS and IBM. When TDP‑43 is lost from the nucleus, cryptic exons are aberrantly included in mRNAs, generating novel peptide sequences. Although highly differentiated, clonally expanded CD8⁺ T cells are observed in patients with TDP‑43 proteinopathies, their precise antigenic targets have remained unknown. Here, we use high‑throughput TetTCR‑SeqHD single‑cell profiling, functional assays, and sequencing to pinpoint two cryptic epitopes—from HDGFL2 and IGLON5—that drive CD8⁺ T cell responses in ALS and IBM.

TCR sequencing in an ALS patient revealed 12 distinct clones (up to 49 cells per clone) targeting the HDGFL2 peptide presented by HLA‑A*03:01. When naïve CD8⁺ T cells were engineered to express a cryptic‑epitope–specific TCR (e.g., TCR‑14), they bound antigen with high specificity, became activated, and selectively killed astrocytes depleted of TDP‑43.

 Together, these findings constitute the first direct evidence that TDP–43–dependent cryptic peptides serve as bona fide neoantigens in ALS and IBM, linking nuclear TDP‑43 loss to adaptive immune activation and cytotoxicity, and suggesting new avenues for immunomodulatory therapies.
