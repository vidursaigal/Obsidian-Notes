CD4 KO

Start with normal J76

guide RNA incubate with Cas9 -> electrophoresis

Measure vs. J76, primary cells? 

Flow

TCRb KO

Start with J76

guide RNA incubate with Cas9 -> electrophoresis

no flow? sequencing.

The electroporator is discontinued, buffers and pipettes will be discontinued within the next years.
Smaller set, might take a few tries
shock cells -> traumatized -> immediately put back into incubator


50 reactions -> iPSCs are difficult he has tried. Jurkat look into optimizations

high amount of DNA concentration -> 2 plasmids (bacterial cultures) ->  Midi-prep kit?  (run is successful)
10mL pipette tip suck up cells -> volume that has DNA can't be more than 1% (1mL) needs concentration 500ng-1ug (need high concentration)

Settings for Electroporator 

No schedule -> book a TC Hood (Move electroporator on a cart) Transfect cells  -> Zap (2minutes) -> lifting cells counting (30minutes). Shouldn't take more than an hour.

6:1, 3:1, 2.5:1, or 2:1 or 1:1 higher on the gRNA

100ug 1ug -> 6.25mol
180pmol - 1-10million T-cells

50pmol cas9 
150pmol gRNA
1 million T-cells


half of each gRNA so that it sums 75; complex them seperately. 25pmol and 75pmol, 2x .
