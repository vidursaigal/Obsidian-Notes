### Protocol Steps:

 **Prepare RNP Complex:**
    - Incubate NLS-Cas9 protein (300–500 ng/μL) with sgRNA (50–100 ng/μL) in an appropriate buffer at room temperature for 10–15 minutes to form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.

1. **Prepare Cells for Electroporation:**
   Cultivate the required number of cells (cell density ∼1–3 × 106 cells/T-25 flask) by seeding a flask  containing fresh growth medium 1–2 days prior to electroporation.  Wash the cells with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) and pellet the cells.
For most optimized protocols, seed with:  
• 1–5 × 105 cells for each 10 μL Neon™ Tip  
• 1–5 × 106 cells for each 100 μL Neon™ Tip
2. **Set Up Neon Electroporation:**
    - Optimize pulse settings based on prior experience or Neon guidelines for T cells. A typical setting might be 3 pulses at 1350 V, 10 ms pulse width.
3. **Electroporation Procedure:**
    - Mix 10 µL of cells with the pre-formed RNP complex in the Neon tip.
    - Electroporate the mixture using the optimized protocol.
    - Prepare 24-well plates by filling the wells with 0.5 mL of culture medium containing serum and  supplements without antibiotics and pre-incubate plates in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.
    - Immediately transfer the electroporated cells into pre-warmed recovery media in a 24-well plate.
4. **Post-Electroporation Recovery:**
    - Allow cells to recover in a CO₂ incubator (37°C, 5% CO₂) for 24 hours.




The electroporator is discontinued, buffers and pipettes will be discontinued within the next years.
Smaller set, might take a few tries
shock cells -> traumatized -> immediately put back into incubator


50 reactions -> iPSCs are difficult he has tried. Jurkat look into optimizations

high amount of DNA concentration -> 2 plasmids (bacterial cultures) ->  Midi-prep kit?  (run is successful)
10mL pipette tip suck up cells -> volume that has DNA can't be more than 1% (1mL) needs concentration 500ng-1ug (need high concentration)

Settings for Electroporator 

No schedule -> book a TC Hood (Move electroporator on a cart) Transfect cells  -> Zap (2minutes) -> lifting cells counting (30minutes). Shouldn't take more than an hour. 



6:1, 3:1, 2.5:1, or 2:1 or 1:1 higher on the gRNA

100ug 1ug -> 6.25mol
180pmol - 1-10million T-cells

50pmol cas9 
150pmol gRNA
1 million T-cells


half of each gRNA so that it sums 75; complex them seperately. 25pmol and 75pmol, 2x
