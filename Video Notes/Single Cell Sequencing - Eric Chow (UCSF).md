Single Cell Sequencing allows you to get specificity on the type of cell (B-cells, T-cells, macrophages etc.). This is in contrast to bulk sequencing. 

After you get the sequence, you can see up to 20,000 genes that are in the human genome.
	Thus, dimensionality reduction collapses this down into two-dimensions. (UMAP)
		After dimensionality reduction, you can cluster to see different cell-types. 
			The same information could be obtained with flow cytometry. However, this allows you to see all of the genes in each cluster, instead of just flow markers. 

You can cluster within each cluster to get better specificity to find more specific gene expression. 

Original Techniques: 
Plate-based SMART-seq - Use flow to sort one cell into each well of 96-well. Lyse the cell and then do a reverse transcription reaction. You end up with cDNA with PCR handles on both ends. This undergoes amplification.

Able to process a few hundred to max a few thousand cells. Also, very expensive. 

New Techniques:
DropSeq - Uses microfluidics, very small droplets. One bead and one cell in each of the droplets. Each bead has many barcoded oligo-dTs, which allows it to capture the cell's RNA.,
