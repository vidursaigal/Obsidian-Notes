TCR-epitope pairs are compiled in curated databases: VDJdb, IEDB, McPAS-TCR

~100,000 TCR-epitope pairs across all databases

Mostly from a few common HLA types

Can use data from databases to annotate epitope reactivity for new TCRs; however, exact annotations are sparse because the datasets are small
