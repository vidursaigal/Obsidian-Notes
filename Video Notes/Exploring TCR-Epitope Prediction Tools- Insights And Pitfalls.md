TCR-epitope pairs are compiled in curated databases: VDJdb, IEDB, McPAS-TCR

~100,000 TCR-epitope pairs across all databases

Mostly from a few common HLA types

Can use data from databases to annotate epitope reactivity for new TCRs; however, exact annotations are sparse because the datasets are small

Machine Learning:

Learn which features are important, predict binding for unseen sequences.

IMMREP22 Workshop - compared and benchmarked a bunch of these models

can learn to differentiate based on sequencing kits instead of real positive and negative
